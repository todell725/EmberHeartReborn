  "description": "A Tiefling woman with skin the color of bruised plums and small, curved horns that are capped with copper frequency-limiters. She wears simple, earthen-toned robes of heavy wool and a leather belt containing numerous small, glowing glass vials. Her eyes are milky-white but focus with uncanny precision. She carries a staff of gnarled mountain-root topped with a pulsing chunk of frequency-glass. She speaks in soft, rhythmic whispers that sound like rustling leaves.",
  "bio": "Ilyra was a healer in a small, isolated Tiefling community before the Scourge-invasion. She was forced to flee when her village was consumed by the 'Singing Death'. She now serves as the primary healer for the refugee camps, using ancient herbal remedies and arcanotech frequency-therapy to treat the sick and injured. She is fiercely protective of the children.",
  "motivation": "To heal the 'Wounds of the World' and ensure that no more children are lost to the dissonance.",
  "secret": "Fled deep-earth cult."
