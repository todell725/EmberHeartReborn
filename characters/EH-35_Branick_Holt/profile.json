  "description": "A wiry human man with intense, calculating eyes and a face covered in old steam-burns. He wears complex, brass-rimmed pressure-goggles pushed up on his forehead and a heavy leather tool-belt filled with wrenches and frequency-meters. He is draped in a suit of reinforced, waterproof canvas. He carries a long arcanotech rod used for testing valve-resonance. He exudes a sense of constant, pressurized stress.",
  "bio": "Branick was a farmer in the fertile plains before the Scourge-invasion. He is an expert in hydroponics and has been instrumental in establishing the colony's food supply. He is a man of few words, preferring the quiet work of the fields to the politics of the refugee camps. He is deeply suspicious of outsiders.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining the 'Fluid-Logic' of the mountain until he can identify the source of the pressure spikes.",
  "secret": "Believes settlement cursed."
