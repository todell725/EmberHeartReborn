  "description": "A plump Halfling woman with a face full of laugh-lines and flour-smudges. She wears multiple, tattered wool aprons over a bright green dress. Her hair is tied into two messy, chestnut buns. She carries a massive iron ladle like a weapon and is constantly surrounded by the steam of a large, copper soup-kettle. She exudes a sense of overwhelming, motherly competence and smells of roasted onions and yeast.",
  "bio": "Orla ran the most popular inn in the Western Basin before the Spire raids. She now runs the refugee-kitchens, turning the meager rations of moss and grain into something resembling edible food. She is the colony's primary source of gossip and knows exactly who is sleeping with whom—or who hasn't eaten in three days.",
  "motivation": "Keeping the 'Table of the Sovereignty' full, even if she has to cook the King's own boots.",
  "secret": "Knows everyone's dirt."
