  "race": "Half-Elf",
  "role": "Refugee Archer",
  "description": "A woman with a lean, whip-cord agile build and long, auburn hair tied into dozens of small, practical braids. She wears light, grey leather armor with deep green accents and a specialized sniper's bracer on her left arm. Her eyes are sharp and amber-toned, catching the dim mountain-light like a predator's. She holds a longbow made of darkened horn, and her quiver is filled with arrows that have frequency-tuned obsidian heads.",
  "bio": "Kyra was one of the many refugees who arrived in the wake of the Star-Shrike's fall. A former forest-guard, she has struggled to adapt to the subterranean life but has found a new purpose in the militia. She is intensely private and observant, noticing the small shifts in loyalty and behavior among the populace that others ignore.",
  "motivation": "Vengeance for her lost homeland; ensuring that the 'Singing Death' stays contained within the Ridge.",
  "status": "Active Militia",
