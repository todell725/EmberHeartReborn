  "description": "A tall, gaunt human man with long, soot-covered fingers. He wears a heavy, tattered wool coat over stained mining leathers. His eyes are large and glassy, often staring into the distance as if reading invisible blueprints. He carries an old, dented surveyor's tool and a map case filled with tattered, oil-stained charts. A faint smell of ozone and old parchment clings to him.",
  "bio": "Darrin was an assistant to the colony's original architect before the first Scourge-invasion. He has a photographic memory for the old tunnel layouts, including the ones that the Council claims no longer exist. He is quiet and secretive, often seen sketching in his map-case during meal-breaks.",
  "motivation": "Rediscovering the 'Ancestral Hub'\u2014a legendary chamber he believes contains the key to the mountain's power.",
  "secret": "Knows sealed shaft location."
