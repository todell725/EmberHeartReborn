  "description": "A scrawny, hollow-cheeked man with a permanent nervous twitch. He wears an oversized, oil-stained tool-belt and a tattered, greasy cap. His skin is pale and sallow, except for the dark circles under his sunken eyes. He carries a small, flickering arcanotech lantern tethered to his wrist by a rusty chain. He frequently bites his nails and looks over his shoulder as if expecting a debt collector.",
  "bio": "Hal is a man who made some very poor choices in the gamblers' dens of the upper colony. He works double-shifts in the mines to pay off his debts to some of the more unsavory elements of the militia. He is constantly looking for 'the big find' that will buy his freedom, though most of his colleagues think he's just digging his own grave.",
  "motivation": "Accumulating enough 'Frequency Chunks' to buy his way out of a broken jaw.",
  "secret": "Gambling debt."
