  "race": "Human",
  "role": "Smith Rep (Council)",
  "description": "A lanky man with strong, wiry arms and charcoal-stained skin. He wears a singed leather apron over simple linen shirts. His face is long and intense, with deep-set eyes that seem to analyze the internal structure of every object he sees. He carries a small, precision-calibrated hammer on his hip. Tiny sparks occasionally dance in his messy, soot-covered hair.",
  "bio": "A prodigy of the Warden-Forge, Elric represents the interests of the smiths and casters. He believes that the future of EmberHeart lies in 'Frequency-Casting'—the blending of traditional smithing with the World-Spark's energy. He is younger than most of the council and often impatient with their political games.",
  "motivation": "Perfecting the arcanotech casting process to create unbreakable shields.",
  "secret": "Found strange metal vein below.",
