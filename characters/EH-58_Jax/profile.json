  "name": "Jax",
  "race": "Half-Orc",
  "role": "Former Saboteur / Laborer",
  "description": "A massive Half-Orc with dull, olive skin and a face crossed by a single, deep crater-like scar on his forehead. He wears simple, tattered mining leathers and a heavy leather apron. His hands are massive and clumsy, but he moves with a surprising, gentle care. He carries a heavy iron shovel and a small, humming frequency-charms around his neck. He smells of damp earth and old grease.",
  "bio": "Jax was part of the original sabotage-attempt on the steam-valves, driven by a cultist's promise of 'Ascension'. After being captured and healed of his mental corruption by Silvara, he has dedicated his life to manual labor as a form of penance. He is often seen clearing the most dangerous rubble-piles.",
  "motivation": "Redeeming himself through hard labor; ensuring that no others fall to the 'False-Song'.",
  "status": "Laborer / Penitent",
