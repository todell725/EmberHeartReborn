  "avatar_url": "",
  "description": "A woman of indeterminate age with skin the color of marble and hair like spun silver. She wears layered, tattered silks of blue and gold and a necklace of small, humming arcanotech beads. Her eyes are large and silver-toned. She carries a heavy, iron-bound sketchbook and a collection of charcoals made from singed frequency-wood. She exude an aura of profound, creative melancholy and smells of lavender and turpentine.",
  "bio": "Lyra was a renowned muralist in the Trade Basin who lost her sight following a Scourge-beam strike. She has since learned to 'see' through the mountain's harmonic vibrations. She creates bizarre, geometric murals on the cave walls that many find unsettling, as they often depict events before they occur.",
  "motivation": "Synthesizing the mountain's 'Future-Vision' into a visual map that the King can use to navigate the void.",
  "secret": "Blind artist sees futures."
