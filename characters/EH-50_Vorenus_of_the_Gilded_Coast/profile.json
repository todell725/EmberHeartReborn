  "description": "A flamboyant human man in his early 40s. He wears multi-layered, shimmering silks of emerald and gold, held together by chains of heavy, polished brass and intricate amulets of frequency-glass. He has a perfectly manicured beard and wears a single, oversized ruby on his thumb. He holds a tall, glass-topped cane containing a miniature, swirling storm-cloud.",
  "bio": "A power-player in the Western Trade Basin who despises the Spires' monopoly on high-grade ore. He values profit above loyalty but hates being extorted. He sees EmberHeart as a high-risk, high-reward investment that could either make him the master of the valley or end his life in a Spire dungeon.",
  "motivation": "To break the Spires' economic stranglehold on the valley and secure a monopoly on Warden-Tech.",
  "connection": "Responded to Silvy's broadcast; potential ally or dangerous debtor."
