  "name": "Zael",
  "race": "Human (Void-Marked)",
  "role": "Exilled Scout",
  "description": "A gaunt human man with skin that has a faint, iridescent sheen. He wears tattered, oil-stained leathers and a heavy, fur-lined cloak that seems to absorb the light around him. His eyes are solid white and he has a jagged scar across his throat. He carries a short-sword of pitch-black glass and a collection of strange, geometric 'Sign-Coins'. He moves with an unsettling, flickering energy.",
  "bio": "Zael was a scout who was lost in the outliers during the first Scourge-invasion. He returned months later, changed and unable to speak. He was exiled by the Council for his 'Corruption' but has recently been seen lurking near the Ridge-ventilation shafts, leaving warning-signs of upcoming seismic shifts. He is the first 'Void-Marked' human to retain his sanity.",
  "motivation": "Acting as a silent, invisible guardian for the colony that turned its back on him.",
  "status": "Exiled / Watcher",
