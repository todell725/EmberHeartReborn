  "race": "Human (Subdued)",
  "role": "Recovering Saboteur",
  "description": "A man in his late 20s with skin that still retains a faint, translucent, grey-violet tint. He wears simple linen clothing and a heavy, arcanotech medical collar that pulses with a stabilizing blue light. His eyes, once solid black, have started to regain their natural brown hue, though the pupils are still oddly square-shaped. He moves with a slow, deliberate energy, as if re-learning how to be human.",
  "bio": "The former 'Prisoner 404'. After the successful harmonic-stabilization performed by the King and his alchemists, Bramen has begun the slow process of recovery. He is the first living subject to be partially 'De-Geometricized'. He possesses a unique, if fragmented, understanding of the Scourge's command-logic.",
  "motivation": "Reclaiming his identity and using his 'Scar-Knowledge' to help the Sovereignty decode the Weaver's next move.",
