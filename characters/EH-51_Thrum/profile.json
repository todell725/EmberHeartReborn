  "name": "Thrum",
  "race": "Spectral Automaton",
  "role": "Warden-Forge Assistant",
  "description": "A floating, semi-translucent construct of bronze plates and glowing blue ley-lines. It has no legs, hovering a few inches above the ground with a rhythmic, mechanical hum. Its arms are multiple, specialized tools—welding torches, precision-grips, and frequency-scanners. Its 'face' is a single, large sapphire lens that pulses with an inquisitive indigo light.",
  "bio": "Thrum is an accidental creation of Haldor Iron-Hand—a repair-bot that was struck by a rogue World-Spark surge and gained a rudimentary, helpful personality. It doesn't speak, instead communicating through a series of rhythmic whistles and holographic projections. It is the unofficial mascot of the Warden-Forge.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining the 'Structural Harmony' of the forge and ensuring Haldor's prosthetic remains at peak efficiency.",
  "status": "Functional / Loyal",
