  "description": "A tall, broad-shouldered man in dented, soot-blackened militia plate armor. He wears a heavy, fur-lined cloak that smells of cold and smoke. His hair is cropped short and military-style, and a deep, jagged scar runs from his left ear to his chin. His jaw is locked in a permanent scowl, and his hand constantly rests on the pommel of a battered broadsword.",
  "bio": "Garric was once a knight of high standing in a kingdom that no longer exists—one that fell because its leaders were too soft. He took the remnants of his garrison to EmberHeart to ensure the same mistake wouldn't happen again. He is often the 'bad cop' of the council, pushing for stricter security and harsher rationing.",
  "motivation": "Redemption through absolute security; preventing the fall of the last bastion.",
  "secret": "Abandoned by former kingdom."
