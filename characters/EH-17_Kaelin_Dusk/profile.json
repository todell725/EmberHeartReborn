  "description": "A lean, agile Half-Elf with pale skin and eyes the color of twilight. He wears form-fitting armor made from treated Displacer-Hide that seems to shimmer and shift in the light. He is draped in a ghillie-cloak of mountain-lichen and tattered mesh. He carries a recurve bow carved from White-Wood, pulsing with a faint blue arcanotech frequency, and a quiver of crystal-tipped arrows. His face is focused, with faint hunting-tattoos around his eyes.",
  "bio": "Kaelin is the primary tracker for the outlying Ridge. He spent years living alone in the shifting wastes before finding the Sovereignty. He is a man of few words, preferring the silence of the hunt. He has an uncanny ability to read the 'scent' of a Scourge-vibration before it even arrives.",
  "motivation": "Protecting the borders of EmberHeart through silent, preemptive strikes against the Scourge.",
  "secret": "Tracks vanish near lava fields."
