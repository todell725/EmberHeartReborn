  "description": "A squat, powerfully-built Dwarf with a face like a pile of gravel and a beard of dark, braided iron jewelry. He wears tattered, oil-stained leathers and a tattered, grey cap. His left leg is a primitive, heavy iron prosthetic that clanks with every step. He carries a massive, short-handled iron sledgehammer and a cluster of arcanotech frequency-anchors hanging from his belt. He exude a sense of immense, quiet physical power.",
  "bio": "Rusk was a high-grade ore-smelter for the Spires before he was discarded for his injury. He escaped the purge by hiding in a slurry-pipe. He is intensely grateful to King Kaelrath for providing him with a 'functional' leg, however primitive. He is the first to volunteer for the heaviest construction projects.",
  "motivation": "Proving that a 'Shattered-Dwarf' is still more useful than a dozen human laborers.",
  "secret": "Hears rumbling at night."
