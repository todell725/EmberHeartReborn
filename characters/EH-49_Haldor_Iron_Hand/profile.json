  "avatar_url": "./Haldor Iron-Hand.png",
  "description": "A massive, muscular man with skin the color of hammered bronze and eyes like molten gold. His left arm is a masterfully crafted iron prosthetic from the elbow down, intricate with copper wiring and small blue World-Spark capacitors. He wears a heavy, singed leather apron over his bare chest, which is etched with smithing-clan tattoos. He holds a massive forging hammer that hums with a low, deep frequency.",
  "bio": "A veteran of the Old Deep, Haldor was one of the first to pledge his hammer to King Kaelrath. He lost his left hand to a crawler, replacing it with a self-forged iron gauntlet that he continuously upgrades. He is the technical heart of the Warden Forge, responsible for the creation of the most advanced arcanotech armor.",
  "motivation": "To see Emberheart's forge fires burning brighter than the Spires' suns, proving the superiority of Warden-craft.",
  "connection": "Kaelrath's primary technical lead in the Warden Forge."
