  "race": "Dwarf",
  "role": "Elder Miner",
  "description": "An ancient Dwarf with a beard so long it has to be wound around his waist like a belt. His skin is like cracked leather, permanently stained with a deep, earthy brown. His eyes are milky-white and blind, but he navigates the tunnels with uncanny precision using a gnarled walking-stick that he taps against the floor. He wears heavy, tattered mining leathers and smells of old stone and tobacco.",
  "bio": "Silas is the oldest living resident of EmberHeart, having survived since the first shafts were dug. He knows the 'Heart-Beat' of the mountain better than any map or sensor. He is often consulted by Borin Ashmantle on matters of deep history and the original 'Deep-Vault' locations. He speaks in long, rambling stories about the days when the stone was 'Still'.",
  "motivation": "Ensuring the mountain's 'Quiet-Places' are respected and preserved as the new colony expands.",
