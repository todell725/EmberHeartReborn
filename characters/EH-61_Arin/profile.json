  "race": "Human (Spark-Touched)",
  "role": "Child of the Spark",
  "description": "A young boy of around seven years old with skin that glows with a soft, ethereal blue light. His eyes are solid indigo and seem to contain swirling nebulae. He wears simple, clean linen tunics and is often seen carrying a small, humming crystal shard as if it were a toy. He exude a sense of profound, unsettling peace and occasionally hums in a frequency that causes small objects to hover.",
  "bio": "Arin was the first child born within the influence of the World-Spark resonance. He is not corrupted, but 'Adapted'. He has a natural, instinctive interface with arcanotech devices and can occasionally stabilize a collapsing frequency-vent just by being near it. He is treated with a mixture of reverence and fear by the populace.",
  "motivation": "Unknown; he seems to simply 'exist' as a manifestation of the mountain's new life.",
