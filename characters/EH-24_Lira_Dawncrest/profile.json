  "description": "A human woman with a slight, whip-cord agile build and long, auburn hair tied into a practical braid. She wears light, grey leather armor with deep green accents and a specialized sniper's bracer on her left arm. Her eyes are sharp and amber-toned, catching the dim mountain-light like a predator's. She holds a longbow made of darkened horn, and her quiver is filled with arrows that have frequency-tuned obsidian heads.",
  "bio": "Lira was the finest archer in Garric's original garrison. She has a reputation for being the 'Quiet Eye' of the militia, often stationary for hours on the Outpost battlements. She is intensely private and observant, noticing the small shifts in loyalty and behavior among the populace that others ignore.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining the 'Silent Vigil'; seeing the threat before the threat sees her.",
  "secret": "Watching someone secretly."
