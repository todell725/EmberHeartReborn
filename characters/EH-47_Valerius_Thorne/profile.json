  "description": "A young, nervous human man with lanky limbs and ink-stained fingers. He wears multiple layers of tattered, grey linen and a heavy leather tool-belt filled with quills and ink-vials. He carries a tattered, iron-bound book of 'Historical-Deeds' and a small arcanotech signal-rod. His eyes are wide and watery, constantly scanning the crowd for interesting stories. He smells of old vellum and vinegar.",
  "bio": "Valerius was a low-ranking scribe in the Concordat's administration who realized that the 'Official-History' was a lie. He escaped with a collection of censored records that detail the early Scourge-sightings. He currently acts as the colony's unofficial historian, recording the stories of the refugees before they are lost.",
  "motivation": "Ensuring the 'True-Tale' of the Sovereignty survives, even if the Sovereignty itself does not.",
  "secret": "Hiding censored records."
