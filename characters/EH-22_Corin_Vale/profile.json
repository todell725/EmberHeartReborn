  "description": "A young human man with a lean, nervous build. He wears a suit of oversized, secondhand militia plate that clatters when he moves. He has a shock of bright blonde hair and a face full of soot-stained freckles. His eyes are wide and constantly scanning the ceiling. He grips a spear with a humming arcanotech tip, his knuckles white with tension. He wears a simple, red-and-grey militia surcoat.",
  "bio": "Corin is a new recruit who was forced into the militia after the last collapse. He is terrified of the dark but even more terrified of letting Garric down. He spends his off-duty hours practicing his thrusts in the training square, driven by a desperate need to find a sense of safety that the mountain continuously denies him.",
  "motivation": "Proving he has the 'Knight's Steel' despite his crushing fear of the deep.",
  "secret": "Fears collapse."
