  "description": "A stout human woman in her late 40s. She wears practical, soil-stained trousers and a thick tunic of homespun wool. Her hair is a mass of wild, grey curls tied back with a piece of twine. Her hands are constantly covered in dark, loamy earth. She carries a heavy arcanotech sprinkler and a bag of 'Spark-Infused' seeds. Her expression is one of grim determination as she inspects a withered, blackened stalk of wheat.",
  "bio": "Sella is the head of the Light-Wheat Cooperative. She is a no-nonsense farmer who treats the arcanotech grow-lights with the same reverence a priest treats an altar. She has noticed the first signs of the 'Soil-Rot' but has kept it quiet to prevent a panic, though the black stains on her hands are becoming harder to wash off.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining the calorie-count of the Sovereignty until the 'Black-Soil' can be purified.",
  "secret": "Soil turning black."
