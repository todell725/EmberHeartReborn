  "description": "A massive Half-Orc with dull, greyish-green skin and a face full of worry. He wears a suit of tattered, reinforced leather and a heavy, dirty apron. His single tusk is cracked and yellowed. He carries a heavy arcanotech pitchfork and a small, humming frequency-pendant. He has a habit of patting the heads of the mutated, three-eyed mountain goats that he treats like his own family. He smells of damp earth and livestock.",
  "bio": "Dorn is the primary caretaker of the colony's 'Frequency-Goats'—creatures that can survive on the mountain's lichen. He is a gentle soul who hates the violence of the tunnels. He has been finding strange, geometric bite-marks on his goats and is terrified that something is coming for the herd.",
  "motivation": "Protecting the 'Life-Stock' from the unseen things that haunt the steam-fields.",
  "secret": "Livestock mutilations."
