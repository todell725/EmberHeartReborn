  "avatar_url": "",
  "description": "A sturdy human woman with a face etched with grief and determination. She wears worn, heavy-plate gauntlets and a simple, tattered wool surcoat over reinforced chainmail. Her dark hair is cut short and unevenly. Her eyes are red-rimmed and intense, showing a deep, simmering anger. She carries a heavy, spiked mace and a shield of dented iron. She stands with a rigid, unnatural posture.",
  "bio": "Hesta lost her only child to the Line 4 collapse, an event she blames on the council's indecision. Since then, she has become the most aggressive member of the militia, often taking the 'suicide shifts' in the lower tunnels. She doesn't seek survival for herself anymore—only vengeance against the mountain's secrets.",
  "motivation": "Killing the 'Shade' in the darkness before it kills anyone else's child.",
  "secret": "Lost child in collapse."
