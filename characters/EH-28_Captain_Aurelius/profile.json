  "race": "Human",
  "role": "Refugee (Former Officer)",
  "avatar_url": "./Captain Aurelius.png",
  "description": "A man in his late 60s with a military bearing that hasn't bowed to age. He wears a tattered, formal dress uniform of a fallen empire, the gold braid tarnished and frayed. His medals are pinned to a chest that has grown thin from rationing. His face is a network of aristocratic wrinkles and sharp, haunted blue eyes. He carries a ceremonial saber with a broken blade. He smells of old cedar and mothballs.",
  "bio": "Aurelius was a high-ranking officer in the Concordat's Southern Command before the Scourge-invasion. He surrendered his city to save the civilian population and has lived with the shame ever since. He acts as an informal elder for the human refugees, teaching the younger ones about the 'Old World' and the necessity of order.",
  "motivation": "Redeeming his honor by ensuring the safety of the children in the colony, even if it means sacrificing himself.",
  "secret": "Surrendered former city."
