  "description": "A small, bird-like Halfling with messy, chestnut hair and large, inquisitive hazel eyes. He wears multiple layers of light, tattered linen and leather, reinforced with small plates of frequency-glass at the joints. He carries a collection of small, humming obsidian-anchors used for marking tremors. He moves with a nervous, jerky energy, constantly twitching his ears toward the mountain's floor. He holds a short, arcanotech signal-rod.",
  "bio": "Perri is the youngest and most enthusiastic of the Ridge scouts. He has a 'perfect ear' for seismic rhythms and can distinguish the sound of a falling rock from a Scourge-march at a mile distant. He is often the first to see things that others miss—though sometimes his imagination gets the better of him.",
  "motivation": "Mapping every vibration in the Ridge until the mountain's heart is totally predictable.",
  "secret": "Saw shape in night steam."
