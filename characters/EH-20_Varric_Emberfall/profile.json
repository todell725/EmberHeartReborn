  "description": "A massive Red Dragonborn with scales the color of cooled magma, dull and soot-stained. He wears a heavy, scorched leather apron and thick iron-plated gloves. His horns are short and blunt, one of them capped with a heat-resistant copper band. His eyes burn with a low, amber glow, mirroring the forge-fires he tends. He carries a massive, soot-blackened smithing hammer across his shoulder and smells strongly of charcoal and hot metal.",
