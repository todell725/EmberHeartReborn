  "name": "Kel Dorn",
  "race": "Human",
  "role": "Miner",
  "avatar_url": "./Kel Dorn.png",
  "description": "A pale, thin human man with large, dark eyes that seem too big for his head. He wears tattered, oil-stained overalls and a tattered, grey cap. His skin is unnaturally cold to the touch and has a faint, translucent quality. He carries a small, arcanotech frequency-tester that constantly emits a low, mournful hum. He moves with a slow, sleepwalking energy, often stopping to stare into empty darkness.",
  "bio": "Kel was the only survivor of the 'Void-Leak' in Shaft 7. Since then, he has claimed to hear 'the mountain's heartbeat' in a way no one else can. His colleagues find him deeply unsettling, as he often answers questions before they are asked. He is tolerated only because his 'instincts' for stable stone are never wrong.",
  "motivation": "Synthesizing the internal 'Void-Song' he hears to find peace for the spirits of the deep.",
  "secret": "Hears whispers underground."
