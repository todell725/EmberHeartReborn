  "description": "A middle-aged man with a permanent, heavy scowl and a face etched with deep lines of worry. He wears a thick, grease-stained leather vest and has a collection of small, humming crystals woven into his beard. His hands are thick and calloused, with missing fingertips on his left hand. He carries a heavy, arcanotech sledge and a small, locket of tarnished brass. He stands with a slight, protective hunch.",
  "bio": "Bran is a veteran miner who lost his younger brother to a 'Frequency Shift' in the lower tunnels two years ago. He is convinced that the brother is still down there, trapped in a 'Time-Leak', and he spends every shift searching the outlier shafts. He is intensely loyal to those who show him even the slightest bit of empathy.",
  "motivation": "Finding his brother or, failing that, ensuring no other brothers are lost to the 'Singing'.",
  "secret": "Brother lost in tunnels."
