  "avatar_url": "./Hobb Rindle.png",
  "description": "A small, wiry Halfling with a face like a dried apple and quick, darting eyes. He wears multiple layers of light, tattered linen and leather, reinforced with small plates of frequency-glass at the joints. He carries a collection of small, humming obsidian-anchors used for marking tremors. He moves with a nervous, jerky energy, constantly twitching his ears toward the mountain's floor. He holds a short, arcanotech signal-rod.",
  "bio": "Hobb was a professional scavenger in the outer wastes before the Scourge-invasion. He has an uncanny ability to find hidden caches of supplies and is an expert at navigating the treacherous tunnels. He is fiercely independent and distrustful of authority, but he has a soft spot for the children of the refugee camps.",
  "motivation": "Finding enough 'Spark-Scraps' to ensure his own survival and the survival of those he cares about.",
  "secret": "Stealing food stores."
