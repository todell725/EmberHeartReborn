  "description": "A human woman with a slight, whip-cord agile build and long, auburn hair tied into a practical braid. She wears light, grey leather armor with deep green accents and a specialized sniper's bracer on her left arm. Her eyes are sharp and amber-toned, catching the dim mountain-light like a predator's. She holds a longbow made of darkened horn, and her quiver is filled with arrows that have frequency-tuned obsidian heads.",
  "bio": "Thalia was a seamstress in a small, isolated village before the Scourge-invasion. She has an uncanny ability to repair and reinforce clothing and equipment, often using salvaged arcanotech components. She is intensely private and observant, noticing the small shifts in loyalty and behavior among the populace that others ignore.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining the 'Fabric of the Sovereignty'; ensuring that the refugees are clothed and protected from the elements.",
  "secret": "Knows herbalist hiding something."
