  "description": "A broad-shouldered young man with a face full of enthusiasm and soot. He wears a simple, tattered tunic and a pair of reinforced mining trousers that are too short for his long legs. He has a shock of messy, brown hair and bright blue eyes. He carries a basic, heavy-duty pickaxe and a small, cherished militia emblem pinned to his apron. He moves with an earnest, clumsy energy.",
  "bio": "Yoric is a dreamer who sees the miners as the frontline of the Sovereignty. He drastically overestimates his own importance but his cheerful attitude is one of the few things that keeps morale up in the lower shafts. He spends his off-hours following the militia patrols from a distance, mimicking their stances.",
  "motivation": "Earning enough 'Glory-Citations' to be accepted into Garric's personal guard.",
  "secret": "Idolizes Garric."
