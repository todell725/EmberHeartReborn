  "description": "A massive Half-Orc with dull, greenish skin and a face covered in old, jagged ritual-scars. He wears heavy, battered splint-mail of dark iron and a wolf-pelt cloak. He has a single, massive tusk that protrudes from his lower lip. His eyes are small and calculating. He carries a heavy, notched battle-axe that smells of old blood and oil. He has a habit of sharpening his tusk with a small whetstone during guard duty.",
  "bio": "Tharok is a former mercenary who saw the 'End-Time' coming and decided that a mountain-fortress was the best place to make a stand. He believes that the refugees are a drain on the Sovereignty's resources and doesn't hide his disdain for them. He is purely loyal to the King's results, not his ideals.",
  "motivation": "Survivial of the strongest; he wants to be part of the force that endures.",
  "secret": "Distrusts refugees."
