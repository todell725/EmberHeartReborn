  "description": "A weathered human woman in her late 50s. She wears heavy, textured council robes of midnight-blue velvet trimmed with singed silver thread. Her salt-and-pepper hair is pulled into a severe, tight bun. Her face is a map of leadership stress—deep character lines and weary, sharp gray eyes that catch the flickering indigo glow of a Warden-Lens. She carries a gavel made from a petrified mountain root.",
  "bio": "Marta Hale wasn't born to rule; she was born to mediate. A former diplomat from the surface-tribes, she led the first wave of refugees into EmberHeart. She is the political glue holding the fractious council together. She believes that the survival of the species outweighs any individual morality—a belief that was tested and broken during the sealing of Line 4.",
  "motivation": "Maintaining civil order at any cost while the 'Weaver' scratches at the edges of their reality.",
  "secret": "Line 4 wasn't sealed for safety; it was sacrificed to contain the 'Weaver'."
