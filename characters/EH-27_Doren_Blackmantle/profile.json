  "description": "A heavily-built Dwarf with a beard that has been stone-dyed a deep charcoal grey. He is encased in ancient, heavy plate armor that is intricately carved with Dwarven runes of protection. He wears a thick, soot-stained cloak made of spider-silk. His eyes are small and sharp, constantly analyzing the stonework of any chamber he enters. He carries a massive, square-headed warhammer and a small book of structural diagrams.",
  "bio": "Doren is an expert in arcanotech stonework and ancient tunnel markers. He joined the Sovereignty to ensure that the refugees didn't inadvertently collapse the entire mountain through their ignorance. He is the militia's primary advisor on tunnel-entry and structural fortification. He speaks in short, clipped sentences about stone-stress and ley-line pressure.",
  "motivation": "Building a 'True Vault' where the Scourge's song can never penetrate.",
  "secret": "Recognizes ancient tunnel marks."
