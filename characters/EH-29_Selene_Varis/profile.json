  "description": "An Elf of ethereal, unearthly beauty with skin the color of marble and hair like spun silver. She wears multiple layers of flowing, tattered silks and a necklace of small, humming arcanotech beads. Her eyes are wide and silver-toned, showing a deep, ancient wisdom. She carries a heavy, iron-bound book of 'Deep-Lore' and a quill that leaves a trail of faint blue light. She exudes an aura of profound, scholarly melancholy.",
  "bio": "Selene was one of the librarians of the Great Spires before the purge. She escaped with a handful of 'forbidden' scrolls that detail the mountain's harmonic history. She is intensely private and rarely leaves the refugee-camps, spending her nights deciphering the mountain's 'Earth-Song'. She smells of old parchment and jasmine.",
  "motivation": "Synthesizing the ancient harmonic data to find a way to 'Sing' the mountain into total stability.",
  "secret": "Hiding forbidden lore."
