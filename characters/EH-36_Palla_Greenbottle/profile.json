  "avatar_url": "./Palla Greenbottle.png",
  "description": "A small Gnome with a face like a dried plum and wild, white hair that sticks out in all directions. He wears a heavy leather vest covered in pockets, tubes, and glowing vials of blue World-Spark liquid. He has a pair of oversized, brass frequency-goggles pushed up on his forehead. He carries a small, arcanotech signal-repeater that hums and clicks in a rhythmic pattern. He is constantly adjusting small dials on his belt.",
  "bio": "Palla is a failed engineer from the Spires who found his calling in the 'dirty math' of the Ridge. He provides the militia with real-time tremor-data and arcanotech maintenance. He talks at a breakneck pace, often about 'harmonic convergence' and the 'dissonance of the deep', though few actually understand him.",
  "motivation": "Synthesizing the perfect signal-dampener to render the Sovereignty invisible to the Scourge.",
  "secret": "Tracking seismic rhythm."
