  "description": "A slender Tiefling woman with pale, lavender skin and sweeping, jet-black horns that curve back like a predator's. She wears layered, earth-toned robes of rough-spun wool, her pockets overflowing with dried lichen and pungent roots. Her eyes are solid, luminescent white, focused with intense concentration as she inspects a cluster of bioluminescent mushrooms. She carries a gnarled wooden staff adorned with small, tinkling charms and smells of crushed mint and damp earth.",
  "secret": "Plants mutating near fissures.",
