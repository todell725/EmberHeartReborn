  "description": "A small Halfling woman with a face permanently dusted with soot and bright, hopeful eyes. She wears a collection of oversized, tattered scarves and a patchwork tunic of many colors. She carries a small, arcanotech frequency-cradle containing a sleeping, oddly pale child. The child's skin has a faint, translucent quality and seems to pulse with a soft blue light. Ilra speaks in a soft, melodic voice to the child constantly.",
  "bio": "Ilra and her family were among the first to benefit from King Kaelrath's arcanotech medical intervention. Her youngest child was born with 'Frequency-Sickness' and only survived because of a specialized stabilizer. She is fiercely loyal to the King and spends her days tending to the hydroponics while singing lullabies to the mountain.",
  "motivation": "Giving her child a future in a world that doesn't oscillate as dangerously as the one they were born into.",
  "secret": "Grateful for Kaelrath's fire; child is currently stabilizing."
