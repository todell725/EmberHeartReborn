  "description": "A woman of ageless grace, standing amidst incense smoke. She wears flowing, translucent robes of white silk embroidered with gold geometric patterns. Her long, dark hair is decorated with small, humming crystals. Her eyes have a faint, luminescent violet tint that glows when she speaks of the mountain. She holds a copper bowl containing a single, floating ember.",
  "bio": "Lysa has always felt the 'hum' of the World-Spark. She isn't a priestess of a god, but a servant of the mountain's logic. She provides spiritual and psychological comfort to the refugees, though many find her unsettlingly detached from mundane concerns.",
  "motivation": "Ensuring the psychological stability of the populace through 'Correct Alignment' with the Spark.",
  "secret": "Nightmares of fire beneath the earth."
