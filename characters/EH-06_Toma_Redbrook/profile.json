  "description": "A barrel-chested human man in his early 30s. He is covered head-to-toe in a fine layer of red-tinted iron dust. He wears tattered, heavy-duty mining overalls over a singed canvas shirt. His eyes are wide and bloodshot, set in a face permanently smudged with soot. He grips a battery-powered pneumatic drill that leaks a faint blue vapor. He stands with a slight tremor in his hands.",
  "bio": "Toma was one of the first miners to be assigned to the lower shafts after the World-Spark resonance began. He is a hard worker but has become notoriously superstitious, often refusing to enter any tunnel that doesn't have a 'blessed' frequency-lamp. He speaks in a low, raspy whisper.",
  "motivation": "Doing just enough work to earn his rations without being sent back into 'The Deep'.",
  "secret": "Refuses lower tunnels."
