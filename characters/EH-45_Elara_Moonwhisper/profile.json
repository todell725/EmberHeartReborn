  "description": "An elderly Elf woman with skin like fine, cracked porcelain and long, flowing hair of brilliant white. She wears heavy robes of dark purple silk and a necklace of small, humming arcanotech beads. Her eyes are clouded with cataracts but see with uncanny precision. She carries a gnarled staff of White-Wood that pulses with a faint green light. She speaks in soft, rhythmic whispers that sound like rustling leaves.",
  "bio": "Elara is a former matron of the Valemere nature-states. She believes that the 'Singing Death' isn't an invasion, but a natural corrective for the planet's harmonic imbalance. She provides spiritual guidance to the elven refugees, often telling stories of the 'Before-Ages' when the mountain was still silent.",
  "motivation": "Guiding the 'Lost-Children' through the harmonic shadow; ensuring they don't lose their souls to the dissonance.",
  "secret": "Believes Scourge is natural."
