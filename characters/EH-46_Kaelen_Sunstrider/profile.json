  "description": "A tall, lithe Elf with a face permanently set in a scowl of intense concentration. He wears light, grey leather armor with deep green accents and a specialized sniper's bracer on his left arm. His eyes are sharp and amber-toned. He holds a longbow made of darkened horn, and his quiver is filled with arrows that have frequency-tuned obsidian heads. He exudes an aura of controlled, lethal energy.",
  "bio": "Kaelen was a guardian of the Valemere borders before the Spires' fire-magic destroyed his home. He blames the Matriarch for her 'softness' and has since become one of the most aggressive defenders of the Sovereignty. He is often the first to volunteer for any recon-mission into the outlier ridge.",
  "motivation": "Vengeance through precision; ensuring that the 'Burners' pay for every hectare of Valemere ash.",
  "secret": "Blames Valemere leaders."
