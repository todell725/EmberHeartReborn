Within forty-eight hours, every bakery in the five-block radius is producing three times normal output from the Mother-Loaf's augmented substrate. The output is nutritionally dense, long-lasting, and in quantities sufficient to make a meaningful contribution to the city's food shortfall.

The final assembly stage does not appear to have been activated. Somewhere in the Forge's operational logic, a condition that would trigger final assembly has not yet been met. The Forge is waiting for something. The Knowledge Keeper, when Dorr relays this assessment, says carefully: 'The Class Omega activation protocol required two-stage authorisation: first, an existential threat identification by the Concordat high council; second, a field commander's activation order to begin final assembly and deployment of the produced units. The forge received the first authorisation \u2014 it would not be running otherwise. It never received the second, because the field commanders did not survive the Scourge to give it.

The Knowledge Keeper, asked for its position directly, gives the most substantive response it has yet produced: 'The Concordat built the Forge because it was afraid. The production was a fear response to an existential threat. The Scourge was that threat, and the Forge could not deploy because the commanders who would have ordered deployment died before it was ready. The threat is over. The production capability exists, and 847 incomplete units remain in storage. These units were made from fear. I would recommend that what fear built should not be completed or used. I would also recommend that what the Forge's engineers knew \u2014 knowledge encoded in the Forge's design, its autonomous maintenance, its crystal-power systems \u2014 should not be destroyed, because knowledge is not weapons.'

She says: 'The right legal disposition for someone who loves something genuinely and was manipulated by a foreign intelligence operative into weaponising that love is not a cell. It is probably a conversation.' The conversation happens over three separate sessions between Winn, the prophet, and Essa-Theel. By the end of the third session, Essa-Theel has asked to join the Theological Dialogue Council. She is the third member of the Temple District who has moved from zealotry to constructive engagement in the past six months through essentially the same process: honest conversation about what they actually believe versus what they were told to believe in service of someone else's agenda.

The prophet is quiet for a long time. Then she says: 'I don't know who I would be without the dreams and the visions and the sense of something large alongside my own thinking. That's a strange thing to admit.' She looks at the acoustic array. 'But I also know it's me saying that \u2014 not you. Right?' The Core says: 'It has always been both.'

Not published \u2014 held. A proprietary interest in life-saving medical research. Phoss agreed because the research was real and the treatments saved lives and he believed the holding structure was a legal protection mechanism rather than a weapon. For twelve years, it was. Then the Crimson Rot appeared. Then the holding structure's owner \u2014 the Plague-Maker \u2014 revealed the arrangement's true weight: a treatment protocol for a deadly pathogen, registered under private control, that the city's Medical Quarter was freely distributing on the assumption that it was public medical knowledge.

The Scourge threat is real. The treatment protocol is real. His willingness to hand everything over and accept whatever outcome the party determines is consistent with someone who has been doing a job, not gathering power. Whether the party recognizes this or approaches him as the 'restart humanity' antagonist of the Vermin thread's surface framing shapes the quality of the final dialogue significantly. The Remnant-Concordat adds urgency and stakes without resolving the Vane question for the party.",

The combat is real and demanding but the central questions are institutional: who represents the Ridge, what happens to the specifications, what accountability means for a commander who believed she was protecting her people by turning other people into weapons. The Elite Battery-Men's partial cognition is the quest's emotional core -- particularly the hesitant third Elite Battery-Man, who may be reached through Persuasion and who serves as the individual face on the mass-atrocity premise. Ollan is the party's reference point throughout: someone who survived what the 140 others did not, who carries the battery's literal weight in his chest, and who ends the thread running a community electoral assembly.",
