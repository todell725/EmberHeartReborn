# Emberheart: World Lore

## 🌍 The Realm
The known continent is politically fractured into four dominant powers, none of which officially claim the Cinder Expanse.

### Continental Powers
1. **The Iron Concordat**: Industrial dwarven alliance. Mining supremacy and engineering dominance. Militarized, secretive. Focus: Preventing rediscovery of "The First Digging."
2. **The Kingdom of Valemere**: Human feudal monarchy. Expansionist and bureaucratic. Possible future territorial claim on the Expanse.
3. **The Verdant Accord**: Elven forest coalition. Protectors of ecological balance. Monitoring corruption spread.
4. **The Ashen Theocracy**: Fire-orthodox religious state. Believes volcanic lands are sacred and require purification.

## 🔥 The Cinder Expanse
The Cinder Expanse is a volcanic highland region characterized by geothermal fissures, sulfuric steam fields, black glass plains, and unstable lava tubes.

**Ancient Maps**: Label it "The Sleeping Caldera."
**Status**: Geologically unstable, resource uncertain, spiritually questionable, politically inconvenient.

### The Tremor Phenomenon
Tremors in the Expanse show anomalies:
- Rhythmic timing patterns.
- Temperature spikes without magma flow.
- Harmonic vibration in tunnels.
- Resonance felt in bone rather than heard.

**The Deep-Earth Theory**: Whispers of a buried primordial elemental, a petrified titan-scale organism, or a subterranean hive consciousness.
