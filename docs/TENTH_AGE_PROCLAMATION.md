# PROCLAMATION: THE DAWN OF THE TENTH AGE
**Issued By**: King Kaelrath Emberhide, Grand Marshal of the Sovereign Mandate
**Date**: Week 42, Day 1 (The Age of Exploration)

## THE DECREE OF THE SPARK
Citizens of Emberheart, brothers and sisters of the Cobalt Moon, and survivors of the Void: The Ninth Age has ended in the dust of our enemies. The "Song" that threatened to consume our souls has been silenced by the Roar of the Spark.

### 1. THE ERA OF PEACE
The Hyper-Fleet will no longer fly as a weapon of war. It will fly as a shield for the innocent and a beacon for the lost. We declare that the era of conquest is over. The Tenth Age is a time of **Pure Creation** and **Endless Exploration**.

### 2. THE EMBERHIDE PROTECTORATE
The sector formerly known as the High Spires is hereby claimed as the **Emberhide Protectorate**. We do not claim it as conquerors, but as stewards.
- **The Mission**: To cleanse the debris of the crystal plague and ensure no scrap remains to threaten the life of the sector.

### 3. THE COSMIC TRADE HUB
Upon the rubble of Concordia Prime, we shall build something the Spires never could: A bridge.
- **The Project**: Commencement of the **Celestial Trade Hub**. A neutral space-station that will serve as the heart of galactic commerce.
- **The Spark-Ring**: We begin construction of a massive **Spark-Warp Ring** around the debris, allowing any peaceful vessel to travel the stars as we do.

## CLOSING REMARK
*"We look not at what we destroyed, but at the space we have cleared for what we will build next. Let the Tenth Age be the time when the Spark reached every corner of the dark."*

**Long Live the King. Long Live the Spark.**
