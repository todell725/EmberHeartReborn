#Level5 #Transmutation ( #Bard, #Druid)

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn’t a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [Awakened Shrub](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194905-awakened-shrub)or [Awakened Tree](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194906-awakened-tree) in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024).

The awakened target has the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.
