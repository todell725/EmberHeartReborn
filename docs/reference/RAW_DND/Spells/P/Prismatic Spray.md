| 5   | **Blue.** _Failed Save:_ 12d6 Cold damage. _Successful Save:_ Half as much damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6   | **Indigo.** _Failed Save:_ The target has the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [Petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition)condition until it is freed by an effect like the [Greater Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spell. The successes and failures needn’t be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7   | **Violet.** _Failed Save:_ The target has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM’s choice).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
