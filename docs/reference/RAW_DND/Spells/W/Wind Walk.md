# [Wind Walk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619211-wind-walk)

#Level6 #Transmutation ( #Druid)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a candle)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has Immunity to the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition)condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action or a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action followed by a 1-minute transformation.

If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.
