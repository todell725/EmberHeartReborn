# Earth Tremor

#Level1 #Evocation ( #Bard, #Druid, #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage and is knocked Prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._**._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
