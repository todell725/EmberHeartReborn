The target hit by the strike takes an extra 3d8 Radiant damage from the attack, and the target has the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the Blinded target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.
