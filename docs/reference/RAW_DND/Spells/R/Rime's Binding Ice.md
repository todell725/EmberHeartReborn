# Rime's Binding Ice

#Level2 #Evocation ( #Sorcerer , #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 Cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an Action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd Level or higher, increase the Cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
