# [Docent](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/215652-docent)

#Wondrousus item, #Rare (requires attunement by a Warforged)_

A _docent_ is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a _docent_, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

**_Sentience._** A _docent_ is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see “Random Properties” below).

**_Life Support._** Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the _docent_ can make a Wisdom ([Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the _docent_ stabilizes you.

**_Random Properties._** A _docent_ has the following properties:

**Languages.** The _docent_ knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a _docent_ knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

**Skills.** The _docent_ has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a d4): (1) [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), (2) [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), (3) [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or (4) [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills).

**Spells.** The _docent_ knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a d6): (1–2) [[Detect Evil and Good]] or (3–6) [[Detect Magic]]. The _docent_ decides when to cast the spell.

**_Personality._** A _docent_ is designed to advise and assist the warforged it’s attached to. One of the simple functions of a _docent_ is to serve as a translator. The _docent’s_ properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your _docent_, it might refuse to assist you.
