# [Daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619083-daylight)

#Level3 #Evocation ( #Cleric, #Druid, #Paladin, #Ranger, #Sorcerer)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect). The sunlight’s area is [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) and sheds [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn’t being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
