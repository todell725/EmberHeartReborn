# [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619080-darkness)

#Level2 #Evocation ( #Sorcerer , #Warlock, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect). [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn’t being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) or [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
