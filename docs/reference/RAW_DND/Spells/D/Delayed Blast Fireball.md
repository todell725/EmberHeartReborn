**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell’s base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn’t ended.

If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature’s space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren’t being worn or carried start [burning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard).

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.
