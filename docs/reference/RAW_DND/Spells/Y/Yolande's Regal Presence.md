You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect). Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 Psychic damage and has the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition)condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
