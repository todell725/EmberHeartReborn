# Catnap

#Level3 #Enchantment ( #Artificer, #Bard, #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall Unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains Unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.
