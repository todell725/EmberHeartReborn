**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn’t being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
