During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it’s capable of laughter, and it can’t end the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition on itself.

At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
