Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the [[Lower Planes]] or [[Upper Planes]] (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- You are immune to Fire and Poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).
- You are immune to the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition ([[Lower Planes]]) or the [Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition ([[Upper Planes]]).
- Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.
- You have a +2 bonus to AC.
- All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.
