# Holy Weapon

#Level5 #Evocation ( #Cleric, #Paladin)

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 Radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 Radiant damage, and it is [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition). At the end of each of its turns, a [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
