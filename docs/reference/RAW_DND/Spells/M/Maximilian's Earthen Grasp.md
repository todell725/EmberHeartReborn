# Maximilian's Earthen Grasp

#Level2 #Transmutation ( #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 30 feet (5-foot square)

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage and is [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) for the spell’s duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) target if you do either.
