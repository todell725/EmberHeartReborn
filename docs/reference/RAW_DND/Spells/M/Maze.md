#Level8 #Conjuration ( #Wizard )

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a [Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
