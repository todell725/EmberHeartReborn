# [Moonbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619134-moonbeam)

#Level2 #Evocation ( #Druid)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) fills the Cylinder, and you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is [shape-shifted](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShapeShifting) (as a result of the [[Polymorph]] spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell’s area moves into its space and when it enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.
