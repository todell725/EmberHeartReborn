# Sickening Radiance

#Level4 #Evocation ( #Sorcerer, #Warlock, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet (30-foot radius sphere)

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant damage, suffer one level of [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition), and emit a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition). The light and any levels of [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
