# [Sequester](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618980-sequester)

#Level7 #Transmutation ( #Wizard )

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition)condition and can’t be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.

If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition, doesn’t age, and doesn’t need food, water, or air.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
