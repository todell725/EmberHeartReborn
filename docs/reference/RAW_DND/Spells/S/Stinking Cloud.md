# [Stinking Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619091-stinking-cloud)

#Level3 #Conjuration ( #Bard, #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [Heavily Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HeavilyObscured). The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind]]) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition)condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature can’t take an action or a Bonus Action.
