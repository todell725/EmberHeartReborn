#Level3 #Transmutation ( #Bard, #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot [Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell’s gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.
