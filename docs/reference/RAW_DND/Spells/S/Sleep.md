Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect.

Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.
