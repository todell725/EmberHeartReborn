#Level5 #Evocation ( #Warlock, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Component:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect) centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) and [Deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition) conditions, and they can’t cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 Radiant damage and 2d10 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
