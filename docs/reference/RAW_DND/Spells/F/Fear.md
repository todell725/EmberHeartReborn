**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 30-foot [Cone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for the duration.

A Frightened creature takes the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.
