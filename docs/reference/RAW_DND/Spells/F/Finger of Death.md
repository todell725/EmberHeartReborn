**Casting Time:** Action

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [Zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775851-zombie) (see [appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/creature-stat-blocks#Zombie)) that follows your verbal orders.
