#Level4 #Abjuration ( #Bard, #Cleric, #Druid, #Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s Speed nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) or [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition)conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition on it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
