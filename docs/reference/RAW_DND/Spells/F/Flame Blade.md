# [Flaming Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618919-flaming-sphere)

#Level2 #Conjuration ( #Druid, #Sorcerer, #Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of wax)

**Duration:** [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), up to 1 minute

You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature’s space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried start [burning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard) if touched by the sphere, and it sheds [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) for an additional 20 feet.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 2.
