# Grasping Vine

#Level4 #Transmutation ( #Druid, #Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action

**Range:** 60 ft.

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an occupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a Grappled creature (no action required).

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4.
