An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10-foot [Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect anything within it. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from areas of effect created by such spells.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The barrier blocks spells of 1 level higher for each spell slot level above 6.
