# [Scroll of Titan Summoning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229017-scroll-of-titan-summoning)

#Scroll, #Legendary

When you take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below (see the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/mm-2024) for the creature’s stat block).

The titan is [Hostile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude) toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn’t large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
