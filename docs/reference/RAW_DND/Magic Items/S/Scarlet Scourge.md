# [Scarlet Scourge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445459-scarlet-scourge)

#Weapon *(whip),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This whip is made from the severed vertebrae of a slain [vampire’s](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195251-vampire) victims. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The whip siphons blood from creatures that it hits. Whenever you hit a Small or larger living creature with the whip that is not a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, the bone blade at its end absorbs some of its blood and gains 1 charge. The whip can hold up to 10 charges and loses its charges whenever you finish a short or long rest. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to convert these charges into healing energy. When you do, the whip loses all its charges and you regain 2 hit points for each charge lost.

For every 5 charges the whip has, the muscle fibers that hold it together loosen and add 5 feet to the weapon’s reach.
