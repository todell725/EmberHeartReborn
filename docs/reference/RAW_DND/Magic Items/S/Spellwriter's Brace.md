# [Spellwriter’s Brace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445514-spellwriters-brace)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare  *(requires attunement by a wizard)*

This writer’s hand brace allows you to prepare four extra spells from your spellbook whenever you finish a long rest. The spells can be no higher than 5th level and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you do, the prepared spells appear on the skin of your arm as abstract spell tattoos that represent them. You can prepare the same spell multiple times in this way, taking the necessary time in order to do so, to create multiple copies of the same spell tattoo.

As an action, you can touch a willing creature and speak the brace’s command word to transfer one of your spell tattoos to it, causing the spell tattoo to disappear from your arm and appear on the creature instead. You can only have one tattoo transferred in this way at a time. Transferring a second spell tattoo causes the first one to disappear.

A spellcaster with a spell tattoo can expend a spell slot of the tattooed spell’s level or higher, using its spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability to do so. Once the spell is cast, its tattoo disappears.

Any spell tattoos created by the brace disappear when you finish a long rest or remove the brace.
