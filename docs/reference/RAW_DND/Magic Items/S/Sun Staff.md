# Sun Staff

#Staff, #Weapon, #Rare *(Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Wizard)* 

Veins of sunstone run through this wooden staff. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack roll using this staff, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.

***Solar Focus.*** You can use the staff as a spellcasting focus. While holding the staff, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your proficiency bonus when you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage. You must use the new rolls. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Sunny Glow.*** As a bonus action, you can cause the staff to glow with sunlight. While glowing, the staff sheds [bright light](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,vision%20and%20light) in a 15-foot radius and [dim light](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,vision%20and%20light) for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use another bonus action to extinguish it.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
