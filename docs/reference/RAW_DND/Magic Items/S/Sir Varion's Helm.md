# [Sir Varion’s Helm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445497-sir-varions-helm)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This helm was worn by the iconic hero Sir Varion, whose feats of fearlessness preceded him wherever he traveled. While wearing the helm, you can hold your breath for up to three times the normal duration.

In addition, when you make a saving throw against being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), you can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the save. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
