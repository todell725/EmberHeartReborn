#Weapon *(spear),* #Rare 

This barbed spear was designed to hunt and trap flying creatures. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a normal throwing range of 40 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, you can speak its command word to create a magical chain that extends from the spear to a point on the ground within 5 feet of you. When you do, the spear remains lodged in the target. Until the spear is dislodged, that target can’t move farther away from the point, and at the end of each of its turns, the target is pulled up to 10 feet closer to the point. An object that weighs more than 4,000 pounds can’t be pulled in this way. The spear is dislodged from the target after 1 minute, or when a creature uses its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, dislodging the spear from itself or another target within its reach on a success. When the spear is dislodged, it deals 2d8 piercing damage to the target it was lodged in and is immediately pulled back to the point. The magical chain then disappears. You can dislodge the spear on your turn by speaking its command word again as a bonus action. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
