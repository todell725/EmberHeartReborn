# [Stonemason’s Companion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445532-stonemasons-companion)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

These tools were crafted by a lonely stonemason with a desire for a companion. You gain a +1 bonus to ability checks made using this set of [mason’s tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/428-masons-tools).

If you are proficient with mason’s tools, you can use these tools to carve 10 gp worth of fine stone into the shape of a Small or smaller creature over the course of a full workday, mimicking the effects of the [[Find Familiar]] spell with the following changes: the familiar is an elemental and, while it remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue.

When the familiar falls to 0 hit points, the spell ends and it crumbles into a pile of nonmagical rubble. While a familiar created by the stonemason’s companion exists, you can’t use the tools to create another one.
