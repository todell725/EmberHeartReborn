# [Seraphim’s Stiletto](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445475-seraphims-stiletto)

#Weapon *(dagger),* #Rare  *(requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

This magic dagger is made from elven gold and a fine sliver of unicorn horn. The dagger has a pool of 20 hit points that replenishes daily at dawn. As an action, you can touch this dagger to a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and speak its command word. When you do, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

When you hit an undead creature with a melee attack using this dagger, you can expend a number of hit points from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining, as part of the attack. When you do, you deal extra radiant damage to that creature equal to twice the number of hit points you expend in this way.
