# [Sir Varion’s Lance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445498-sir-varions-lance)

#Weapon *(lance),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This weighty lance was originally designed for Sir Varion, a brave knight with a famous disregard for horses. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the [heavy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Heavy) property, but is uniquely balanced to function well in close-quarters combat. Attacking a target within 5 feet of you with this weapon doesn’t impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

If you are attuned to [[Sir Varion's Shield]], you can wield this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also holding the shield.
