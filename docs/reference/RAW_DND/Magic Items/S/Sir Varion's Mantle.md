# [Sir Varion’s Mantle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445499-sir-varions-mantle)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This sturdy, waterproof riding cape once belonged to Sir Varion, a famed knight known for his charm and eccentricity. While wearing this cape, you can spend 10 minutes to cast the [[Find Steed]] spell from it. When you do, the summoned steed is in the form of a [giant toad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195029-giant-toad). The steed remains for the duration or until your attunement to the mantle ends. When the steed drops to 0 hit points, this property can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.

In addition, while you’re mounted, you have advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.
