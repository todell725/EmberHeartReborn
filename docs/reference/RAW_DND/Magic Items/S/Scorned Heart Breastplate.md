# [Scorned Heart Breastplate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445462-scorned-heart-breastplate)

#Armor *(breastplate),* #Rare  *(requires attunement)*

This brass breastplate is torn apart in its center by a crimson gemstone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for every two allies within 10 feet of you (up to a maximum of +2) while you wear this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you can cast [[Hellish Rebuke]] (save DC 15) as a 3rd-level spell from it, using your reaction. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.

**_Curse._** This armor is cursed. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws to resist becoming [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), and you have disadvantage on Charisma checks to interact with any creature you find attractive.
