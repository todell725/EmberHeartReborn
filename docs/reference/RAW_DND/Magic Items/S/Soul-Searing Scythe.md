# [Soul-Searing Scythe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445509-soul-searing-scythe)

#Weapon *(halberd),* #Legendary  *(requires attunement)*

This brass weapon was forged in the heart of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the scythe, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing soul-rending flames to erupt from the holes in the blade. These flames are harmless to you and shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the scythe.

While the scythe is ablaze, it deals an extra 3d4 fire damage to any target it hits. This damage ignores fire resistance and immunity, and it becomes necrotic damage when it hits a creature with the Fire Absorption trait.

In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a creature that is not a construct or undead, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d4 necrotic damage and is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition)until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage and isn’t stunned.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, its body and soul are immolated and destroyed unless it is a construct or undead. A creature whose body and soul have been destroyed by the _soul-searing scythe_ can be restored to life only by a [[Wish]] spell or divine intervention.
