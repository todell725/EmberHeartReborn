# [Slaying Longbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445504-slaying-longbow)

#Weapon *(longbow),* #Legendary *(requires attunement by a good-aligned creature)*

This powerful longbow originally served a [solar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195208-solar), one of the mighty celestials that guard the heavens from evil. Normally unwieldy in the hands of mortals, this bow was bestowed upon a heroic human centuries ago and has been carefully passed down ever since. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic weapon, it takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

In addition, when you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with this bow against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. On a success, a creature takes an extra 6d8 radiant damage from the hit instead. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it is good-aligned or has legendary actions.
