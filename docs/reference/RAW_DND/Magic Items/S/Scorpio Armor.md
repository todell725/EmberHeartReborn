# [Scorpio Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445463-scorpio-armor)

#Armor *(half plate or plate),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This armor is made from the treated carapace of a [giant scorpion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195026-giant-scorpion). You can benefit from the armor, as described below, even if you aren’t attuned to it.

While wearing this armor, it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks while you’re in dim light or darkness. However, your speed is reduced by 5 feet while you’re in sunlight, as the armored husk recoils and constricts from it.

While attuned to this armor and wearing it, you have advantage on saving throws against poison. In addition, you can use a bonus action to close your eyes and speak the armor’s command word. When you do, you create an instantaneous pulse of awareness around you, immediately alerting you to the presence and location of any creature within 30 feet of you that’s on the ground as if you had [tremorsense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Tremorsense) out to a range of 30 feet. Once the armor’s command word has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.
