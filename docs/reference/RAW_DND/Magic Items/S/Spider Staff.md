# [Spider Staff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247088-spider-staff)

#Staff, #Rare *(Requires Attunement by a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

The top of this magic quarterstaff is shaped like a spider. It deals an extra 1d6 poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

_**Spells.**_ The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [[Spider Climb]] (1 charge) or [[Web]] (2 charges; spell save DC 15).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
