# [Siege Staff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445492-siege-staff)

#Staff, #Rare *(requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This stony staff has been carved into the shape of a castle tower. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties, which use your spell save DC and spell attack bonus, and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a the staff crumbles into rubble and is destroyed.

**_Battering Strike._** This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the target to take an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it’s also pushed 5 feet away from you. In addition, when you attack an object with the staff and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

**_Fire Pot._** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast the [[Grease]] spell from it. You can increase the size of the square covered by the spell by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend in this way (up to a 20-foot square). When you expend 2 or more charges to cast the spell in this way, creatures also take 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Trebuchet._** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to magically create and fling a boulder at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it’s Medium or smaller, it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn’t pushed. Maximize the bludgeoning damage dice against any object or structure hit by the boulder. After it lands, the boulder disappears.
