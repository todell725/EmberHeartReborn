#Wondrous *Item*, #Legendary

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[Oil of Slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of _Sovereign Glue_ takes a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[Universal Solvent]] or [[Oil of Etherealness]], or with a [[Wish]] spell.
