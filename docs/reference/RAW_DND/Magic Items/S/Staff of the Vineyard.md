# [Staff of the Vineyard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445522-staff-of-the-vineyard)

#Staff, #Uncommon *(requires attunement by a cleric, druid, monk, or ranger)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. A clutch of up to 10 grapes hangs from the end of the staff’s magical length of vine. A creature within reach of the staff can use an action to eat one of the grapes, which duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the [[Goodberry]] spell. 1d10 eaten grapes regrow on the clutch daily at dawn.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the [[Entangle]] spell from it (save DC 13), causing twisting grapevines to sprout from the ground in the target area. If a creature [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) by these vines makes a Strength check to free itself and fails, that creature becomes magically drunk until the end of its next turn. A drunk creature is [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) for the duration. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
