# Snicker-Snack

#Weapon *(Greatsword)*, #Legendary *(Requires Attunement by a Non-evil Creature)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn't have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

While attuned to _Snicker-Snack_, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Sentience.** _Snicker-Snack_ is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. _Snicker-Snack_ craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.

_Snicker-Snack_ has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword's trust by making a contested Charisma check against _Snicker-Snack_. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can't be restored in any other way.
