# [Scepter of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445460-scepter-of-faith)

#Rod, #VeryRare *(requires attunement by a cleric)*

This rod is imbued with the last remaining magic from a pious saint. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[Shield of Faith]] spell from it on a creature other than you within range. When an attacker within 60 feet of you deals damage to a creature under the effect of this spell, you can use your reaction to cause a spectral shield to appear before it and push the attacker 5 feet away from the creature.

In addition, while holding the rod, you can use an action to cast either the [[Guardian of Faith]] or [[Find the Path]] spell. When cast in this way, [[Find the Path]] can only be used to find the route to a temple or other holy site. Once the rod has cast either of these spells in this way, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
