# [Skyglider Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445502-skyglider-shield)

#Armor *(shield),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This rust-colored shield is made from the scales and leathery hide of a [wyvern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195273-wyvern). While holding the shield, you have resistance to poison damage. In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you fall while holding the shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the shield’s charges to cause a pair of wyvern wings to magically outstretch from the shield. While the wings remain outstretched, you fall at a rate of 10 feet per round and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide horizontally as you descend so long as you hold onto the shield. If you land on the ground while falling in this way, you take no damage from falling. You can’t [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) while using the shield to fly, and this flying speed can’t be increased in any way. You can use the shield to gain altitude when flying in this way, but must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot you fly upward. The wings refold immediately if you land or at the end of your turn if you didn’t fly at least 15 feet on that turn.
