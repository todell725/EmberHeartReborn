# [Sream’s Stoppered Oasis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445519-sreams-stoppered-oasis)

#Potion, #Rare 

This tall decanter is filled with water from a miraculous oasis in the H’rethi Desert and is stoppered with a small, overgrown planter. You can pour the water out of the bottle on top of the planter as an action to create a magical oasis that fills up to a 100-foot-square space over the course of 10 minutes.

The oasis has a pond filled with clean water and exotic, fruit-bearing trees that can nourish up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The area within the oasis is always under the effects of the [[Alarm]] spell. A [swarm of poisonous snakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17030-swarm-of-poisonous-snakes) appears to defend the oasis for each creature that sets off the alarm (maximum of 3), whose rattling tails act as the audible alarm. The swarms are friendly to you and your companions, but don’t obey verbal commands. Roll initiative for the summoned swarms as a group, which have their own turns. A swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when there are no more hostile creatures within the oasis.

The oasis remains for 24 hours or until dispelled by a [[Dispel Magic]] spell cast at 5th level or higher. The atmosphere within the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside the oasis. A friendly creature within the oasis can’t be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and regains an extra 1d4 Hit Dice when it finishes a long rest.

Drinking the water in the bottle has no effect, but tastes refreshing.
