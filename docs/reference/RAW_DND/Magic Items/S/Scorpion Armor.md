# Scorpion Armor

#Armor *(plate)*, #Rare *(Requires Attunement)*

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated.
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_).

**_Curse._** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10 + 45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [[Wish]] spell can remove the armor's curse.
