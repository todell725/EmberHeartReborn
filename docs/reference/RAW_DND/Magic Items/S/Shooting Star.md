#Weapon *(longbow),* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement)*

Tiny specks of starlight gleam from the dark surface of this magic longbow at night. The bow is strung with an [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) string that appears only when it’s drawn. When pulled, the string emits a soft yellow glow as motes of starlight appear and float around the bow’s frame. Drawing the bow without first nocking an arrow creates a magic arrow of pure starlight in its place and intensifies the bow’s glow. The starlit arrow shines bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon when you use a starlit arrow, which deals radiant damage instead of piercing damage. Hit or miss, the starlit arrow disappears immediately after the attack.

**_Falling Stars._** As an action, you can speak the bow’s command word and fire a starlit arrow into the air above you, choosing a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The arrow immediately vanishes and creates a shower of tiny, magical stars that fall and land in a 30-foot-radius circle on the ground centered on the point you chose. Each creature of your choice within the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 radiant damage and 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as a shower of magical stars slam into the ground around them. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.

In addition, when you use a starlit arrow and roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, a tiny magical star appears and strikes the target. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 radiant damage and 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Immediately after a falling star hits the ground or a target, it disappears.
