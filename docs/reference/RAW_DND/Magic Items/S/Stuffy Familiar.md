# [Stuffy Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445537-stuffy-familiar)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This small stuffed animal is soft to the touch and perfect for hugging. If you can cast the [[Find Familiar]] spell, you can use the animal as the material component for the spell, without it being consumed. When you do, the familiar inhabits the form of the stuffed animal, whose appearance you can change as part of casting the spell in this way. The familiar is a construct, in addition to being either a celestial, fey, or fiend, but its statistics are otherwise unchanged from its normal form. The familiar’s stuffed animal form must be appropriate to the statistics of its normal animal one. For example, a familiar within a griffon stuffed animal could use the statistics for a cat or hawk, but not a poisonous snake. The stuffed animal grows or shrinks to match the size of the familiar’s normal form.

While the familiar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal stuffed animal. If you temporarily dismiss the familiar, the stuffed animal and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together. If the familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the stuffed animal behind.
