#Staff, #Rare *(Requires Attunement by a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

_**Spells.**_ The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [[Mage Armor]] (1 charge) or [[Shield]] (2 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.
