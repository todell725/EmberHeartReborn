# Skull Helm

#Wondrous *Item*, #VeryRare *(Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this skull-shaped helm, you have resistance to Cold, Poison, and Necrotic damage.

Additionally, while wearing the helm, you can cast [[Spirit of Death]] from it without requiring material components. Once you use the helm to cast the spell, the helm can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
