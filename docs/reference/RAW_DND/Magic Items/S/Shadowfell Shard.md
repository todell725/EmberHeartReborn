# [Shadowfell Shard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2408242-shadowfell-shard)

#Wondrous *item*, #Rare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This dull, cold crystal sits heavy and leaden, saturated by the [[Shadowfell]]’s despair. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.
