# [Rod of Storms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445434-rod-of-storms)

#Rod, #Rare *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This silver rod crackles with energy and can redirect or release powerful electric surges. While holding it, if a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes lightning damage, you can use your reaction to halve that lightning damage and choose another target you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take lightning damage equal to the lightning damage taken by the creature.

**_Spells._** The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[Lightning Bolt]] spell (save DC 15) from it.

In addition, you can use an action to expend 1 of the rod’s charges to cast the [[Call Lightning]] spell (save DC 15) from it if the spell is on your spell list. If you take lightning damage from a bolt of lightning you call down in this way, the rod regains 1 expended charge.
