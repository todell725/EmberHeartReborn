#Ring, #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

When you use an action to restore hit points to a creature other than yourself while wearing this winged ring, you become infused with heroism. You gain [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your spellcasting modifier, and until the end of your next turn, you are immune to being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).
