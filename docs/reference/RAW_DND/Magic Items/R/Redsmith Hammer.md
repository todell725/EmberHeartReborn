# [Redsmith Hammer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445401-redsmith-hammer)

#Weapon *(light hammer),* #Common 

This dwarven smithing hammer has runes running from end to end. When beaten against an anvil, the runes around the hammer glow a bright red and emanate heat, allowing a blacksmith to use the hammer to mold weapons and armor using only the hammer and anvil.
