# [Ring of Misdirection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445419-ring-of-misdirection)

#Ring, #Rare 

This dark silver ring is covered in chiseled, dune-like swirls that seem to shift and change throughout the day. When found, this ring has 1d3 + 3 charges. While wearing the ring, you can use your reaction whenever you’re hit by an [opportunity attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) to expend 1 of the ring’s charges to cast the [[Mislead]] spell. When you do, your illusory double is hit by the attack, instead of you, and you and the double can immediately move up to your remaining speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This version of the spell doesn’t require [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), but lasts until the end of your next turn, instead of 1 hour. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.
