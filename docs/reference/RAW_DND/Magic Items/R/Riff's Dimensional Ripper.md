#Weapon *(dagger),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This roughly forged dagger of [goblin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16907-goblin) make has somehow been enchanted with weak, planar magic. This magic dagger has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the dagger within 5 feet of a creature at least one size larger than you, you can use an action to expend 1 of the dagger’s charges to create and slip through a brief, planar tear, reappearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature on the opposite side of it. When you do, you can immediately make one weapon attack with this dagger against that creature. If the attack hits, that creature takes an extra 1d6 force damage and can’t take reactions until the end of your turn.

If using the dagger in this way would cause you to move more than 20 feet, you are shunted out of the planar tear and reappear in your original space instead. When this happens, you take 4d6 force damage, and the action is wasted.
