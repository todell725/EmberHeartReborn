# [Rope of Entanglement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228989-rope-of-entanglement)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Rare

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space) or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If you’re still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target’s space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
