#Staff, #Legendary *(requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This crimson and gold staff exudes authority and is always warm to the touch. While held, a mote of harmless fire sparks into life and floats above its crown-like head.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage. You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 15 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff erupts into a pillar of flame and is destroyed. The flames erupt in a 20-foot-radius cylinder that’s 80 feet tall. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Protective Flame._** When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack while you’re holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend any number of charges from the staff to reduce the attack’s damage against you by an amount equal to 5 times the number of charges you expend. If the attacker is within 5 feet of you, it also takes fire damage equal to the amount of damage that was reduced in this way.

**_Spells._** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [[Fire Shield]] (4 charges, warm shield only), [[Fireball]] (3 or more charges), or [[Scorching Ray]] (2 or more charges). When you cast [[Fireball]] or [[Scorching Ray]] from the staff in this way, you can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
