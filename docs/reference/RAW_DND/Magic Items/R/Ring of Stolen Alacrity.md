#Ring, #Uncommon 

This ring has a loose outer layer that’s covered with illustrations of a person caught in various stages of running. If you spin the outer layer, the person appears to animate and run.

If you aren’t [surprised](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Surprise) while wearing this ring, you can use your reaction when you roll for initiative to spin the ring and speak its command word. You use this reaction after you know the initiative order, if the GM shares it with you, but before any creature takes its turn. Choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that also rolled for initiative. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or swap the total of its initiative roll with yours. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

If the GM doesn’t share the initiative order with you, you can choose up to three creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you as part of this reaction. You immediately learn whether each of those creatures acts before or after you in the initiative order. Afterward, choose one of those creatures to make the saving throw as normal.
