# [Rod of Resurrection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5395-rod-of-resurrection)

#Rod, #Legendary *(Requires Attunement)*

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it: [[Heal]] (expends 1 charge) or [[Resurrection]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
