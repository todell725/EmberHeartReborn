# [Ring of Solar’s Sight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445421-ring-of-solars-sight)

#Ring, #Rare  *(requires attunement)*

This gilded ring has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[Hunter's Mark]] spell from it, which lasts for 1 minute. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls made against any target you mark with the spell in this way, and on a hit, the attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon’s normal damage type.
