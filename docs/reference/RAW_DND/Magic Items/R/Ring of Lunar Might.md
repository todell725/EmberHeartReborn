# [Ring of Lunar Might](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445418-ring-of-lunar-might)

#Ring, #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This intricate ring has various flowing designs that are both entropic and patterned in nature. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to create an area of gravitational force that extends from you in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. The area moves with you and remains as long as you [concentrate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 10 minutes. You have a semblance of control of the gravity within this cylinder. A friendly creature other than you spends 1 foot of movement for every 2 feet it moves within the area, while hostile creatures must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved instead.

For the duration, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to try and overwhelm a creature that you can see within the cylinder with a wave of intense gravity. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). In addition, you can use a bonus action on your turn to pull or push any water within the area up to 20 feet toward you or away from you, up to the outside of the cylinder. This effect lasts for the duration of the cylinder or until you use a bonus action to change the water’s direction or end the effect.

Once the ring has been used to create an area of gravitational force, it can’t do so again until the next dusk.

Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the ring’s command word to cast the [[Reverse Gravity]] spell (spell DC 16) from it. Once the ring has been used in this way, it loses this property.
