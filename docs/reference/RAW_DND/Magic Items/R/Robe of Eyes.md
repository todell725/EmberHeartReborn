# [Robe of Eyes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228976-robe-of-eyes)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Rare *(Requires Attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

**All-Around Vision.** The robe gives you Advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on sight.

**Special Senses.** You have [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) and [Truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight), both with a range of 120 feet.

**_Drawbacks._** A [[Light]] spell cast on the robe or a [[Daylight]] spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition)condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for _Light_ or DC 15 for _Daylight_), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
