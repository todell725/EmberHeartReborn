# [Royal Blade of Amphibios](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445440-royal-blade-of-amphibios)

#Weapon *(rapier),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This expertly crafted blade is ornamented with rose gold designs of frogs and lily pads. While holding the rapier, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground, you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes at a time, and you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet. In addition, any creature with the Amphibious trait can understand the meaning of your words when you speak, though you gain no special ability to understand them in return.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the blade has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action while holding the weapon, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges to transform the blade into a lashing, silver pseudopod that loosely resembles a frog’s tongue. Until the end of your turn, the weapon adds 10 feet to your reach when you attack with it and deals slashing damage, instead of piercing, and on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet straight toward you.
