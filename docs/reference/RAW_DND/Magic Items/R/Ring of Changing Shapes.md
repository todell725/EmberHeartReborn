# [Ring of Changing Shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445416-ring-of-changing-shapes)

#Ring, #Rare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This magic ring is made of solid mercury that bubbles and flows freely around your finger whenever you cast a spell. While wearing the ring, you gain the following benefits:

**_Shift Spell._** When a spell you are casting fails because of a [[Counterspell]] cast by another creature, you can spend 3 sorcery points as a reaction to immediately cast a different spell of the same level or lower without expending another spell slot. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

To be eligible, the new spell must have the same casting time as the first one and can’t consume any material components.

**_Spell Surge._** As a bonus action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to cast a spell no higher than 5th level that has a casting time of 1 action, even if you’ve already used your action to cast a spell on this turn. When you do, you can’t move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
