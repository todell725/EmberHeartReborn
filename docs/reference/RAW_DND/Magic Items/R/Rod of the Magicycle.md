# [Rod of the Magicycle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445435-rod-of-the-magicycle)

#Rod, #Rare 

This sturdy antler rod is capped on either end with a plush leather handle. You can twist the two handles in opposite directions as an action, releasing an unearthly roar audible out to 100 feet and causing the rod to magically split apart and form a powerful, two-wheeled vehicle made of wood, with the rod’s handles at its front. You can twist the handles again as an action to return the vehicle to its rod form. The vehicle can appear underneath you, with you standing astride it, or in an empty space within 5 feet of you (your choice). The vehicle is a Medium magical object, called a magicycle, and has the following properties:

- The vehicle has AC 14, 40 hit points, and a speed of 60 feet. While moving, its AC becomes 17. When underwater, it ceases to function and immediately reverts to its rod form.
- The vehicle weighs 200 pounds. If it falls [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition), it can’t right itself until a creature within reach pulls it upright as an action.
- One Small or Medium creature drives and steers the vehicle. It can carry up to 300 pounds and comfortably fits either one Medium creature or two smaller ones.
- If the vehicle moves in a straight line for 600 feet, its speed increases to 100 feet until the next time it makes a significant turn or until it slows down or comes to a stop.
- For every uninterrupted period of 8 hours that the vehicle is in its rod form or goes unmoved, it regains 1d8 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its rod form and can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.
- When you make a Dexterity saving throw while riding the vehicle, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. On a successful save, you can drive the vehicle up to 20 feet as part of the reaction. If moving in this way causes you to no longer be in the triggering effect’s area, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell, you instead take no damage, instead of half damage, from the effect. On a failed save, you and the vehicle fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).
