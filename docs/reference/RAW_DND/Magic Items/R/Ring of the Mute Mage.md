# [Ring of the Mute Mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445425-ring-of-the-mute-mage)

#Ring, #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This dark silver ring looks like a tongue wrapped around your finger with an amethyst pressed into it. The Undercommon word for “silent” is inscribed into the ring’s tongue. While wearing the ring, the same word becomes harmlessly written on your own tongue, and when you cast a spell of 3rd level or lower that requires only verbal components, you can choose to cast the spell using somatic ones instead. Any spell that requires a target to hear its verbal component gains no benefit from this property. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
