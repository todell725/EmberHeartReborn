# [Roaring Whip](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445430-roaring-whip)

#Weapon *(whip),* #Uncommon 

This magic whip releases a thunderous burst of sound from it when snapped that can damage faraway targets with its ferocity.

When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action while holding this whip, you can use it to attack a target that’s up to 5 feet outside your normal reach with the weapon. On a hit, the weapon’s damage die changes to a d6 and deals thunder damage instead of slashing damage. Hit or miss, it emits the sound of a roaring lion audible out to 100 feet.
