# [Rival Coin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228975-rival-coin)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Common

This gold coin has a creature embossed on each side. The two depicted creatures must be famous rivals or enemies of each other. For example, a _Rival Coin_ might show [[Iggwilv]] on one side and [[Mordenkainen]] on the other, or [[Venger]] on one side and [[Tiamat]] on the other. One of these figures is on the “heads” side of the coin, the other on the “tails” side.

The coin has 1 charge and regains its expended charge daily at dawn. You can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to toss the coin, expending its charge. Roll any die to determine whether the coin comes up heads (on an even number) or tails (on an odd number). The roll also determines the effect:

**Heads.** Target one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Tails.** You take 1d4 Psychic damage.
