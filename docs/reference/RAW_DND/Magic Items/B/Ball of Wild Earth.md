#Wondrous *item,* #Common 

This Tiny, sentient pebble is covered in dirt and is likely a remnant of a [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) [earth elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194980-earth-elemental). It rolls about on its own in search of new and unique sources of dirt. When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly _ball of wild earth can_magically reshape the dirt it’s covered in to form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the pebble at its center by doing so.

The _ball of wild earth_ is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 10 feet and can only move by rolling across the ground. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The ball regains all its hit points if it’s left buried underground for at least 1 hour.

**_Sentience._** The _ball of wild earth_ is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 4. It has hearing and [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. It can’t speak or read, but understands Common and Terran.

**_Personality._** The _ball of wild earth_ is most happy when rolling through rich, healthy soil. Most can be found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. The quickest way to make a _ball of wild earth happy_ is to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the ball can make vague facial expressions based on the emotions its seen other creatures make.
