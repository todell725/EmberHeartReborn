# Blasted Goggles

#Wondrous *Item*, #Uncommon *(Requires Attunement)*

These tinker's goggles have 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to shoot a beam of fiery light from the goggles at a creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 Fire damage. The goggles regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Cursed.*** The goggles are cursed, and becoming attuned to them extends the curse to you. You can't remove the goggles or end your attunement to them until you are targeted by a [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic.

Whenever you use the goggles' fiery beam and the target rolls a 20 on the d20 for the saving throw, the goggles expose you to a flash of violent [bright light](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,vision%20and%20light). As a result, you have the blinded condition for 24 hours.
