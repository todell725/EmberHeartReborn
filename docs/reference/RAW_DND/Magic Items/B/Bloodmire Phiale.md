This shallow, ceramic drinking bowl is enchanted to repurpose spilled blood into new life. The bowl holds up to 8 ounces of blood. Once filled, the blood begins to slowly swirl on its own. If left to sit for 1 hour without spilling, the blood in the bowl becomes a gruesome tonic that pulses with a faint, internal glow.

Drinking the entire bowl of still blood causes one of two effects. Roll a d12. On a 12, you take 12 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are stable. On a roll of 11 or lower, you instead regain a number of hit points equal 4 + the number rolled. The blood is thick and sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste.

The blood’s magic fades if it’s poured from the bowl without being drunk. Once the bowl has been used in this way, it can’t be used again until 1d4 days have passed.
