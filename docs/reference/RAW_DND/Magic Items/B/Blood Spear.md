# Blood Spear

#Weapon *(spear),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and be lived underground. in battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first _blood spear_, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.
