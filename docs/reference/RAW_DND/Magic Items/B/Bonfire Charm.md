This fiery glass sculpture is 4 inches tall and has a small, magical ember inside. When placed on a burning campfire or torch, the charm and ember enchant the fire with a faint, healing radiance. If you or any friendly creatures within the fire’s light regain hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures treats a Hit Die roll of 1 as a 2.
