# [Bounder’s Ball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445009-bounders-ball)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This enchanted strip of metal is bound to a friendly spirit, which emits a faint glow and seems to vibrate with excitement when held. When you throw this item, a playful animal spirit appears beside you and chases after it. Immediately after you throw it, the spirit returns the ball to you.

You can attach the _bounder’s ball_ to the base of a weapon that does not have the heavy property by pressing it against the weapon for at least 10 minutes. Once you do, you can use a bonus action to speak the ball’s command word to cause the weapon to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or stowing the weapon puts out the light. When you make a ranged attack with the glowing weapon, the ball’s animal spirit appears and happily retrieves it. Immediately after the attack, the spirit returns the weapon to your hand or drops it at your feet (your choice).

You can remove the ball from the weapon over the course of a short rest by gently tugging at it, as if from an animal’s mouth. The spirit is ethereal and doesn’t occupy any space. If you have a _companion’s band_ (see _The Griffon’s Saddlebag: Book One_), the spirit can interact with the one created by the band.
