# [Bag of Bellstones](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444980-bag-of-bellstones)

#Wondrous *item,* #Common 

This cloth bag shines like brass and can hold up to 20 small stones. When found, the bag has 1d12 + 8 stones inside. When you remove a stone that’s been in the bag for at least 1 minute, it becomes magical until the end of the turn, if it isn’t already. While a stone is magical in this way, it emits a clear, bell-like ringing that’s audible out to a range of 60 feet whenever it hits a target or touches an object or surface.
