# [Beads of Meditation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444988-beads-of-meditation)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This beaded necklace can be used as a set of prayer beads or special rosary. While wearing or holding the beads, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition).

If you’re a cleric, monk, or paladin, you can use an action to hold onto the beads to further channel your spirituality. If you’re a monk, you regain 1d4 + 1 expended ki points. If you’re a cleric or paladin, you regain one use of your Channel Divinity. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
