# [Bracers of the Iron Octopus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445014-bracers-of-the-iron-octopus)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

These iron bracers are ornamented with an embossed octopus and tentacle designs. While wearing the bracers, you gain a +5 bonus on ability checks and saving throws to resist and escape from being [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition).

In addition, you can use an action to speak the bracers’ command word. When you do, the bracers’ iron and leather twist and writhe, falling off your arms. The bracers become a giant octopus at a point within 10 feet of you under your control that acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the bracers to their normal form in a space formerly occupied by the octopus.

This octopus is made of leather and iron, is a construct instead of a beast, and has a +2 bonus to its AC. On your turn, you can mentally command the octopus if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). You decide what action the octopus takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the octopus is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its bracer form. The bracers then shatter and are destroyed. If the octopus reverts to bracer form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.
