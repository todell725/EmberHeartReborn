#Weapon *(dagger),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This sharp knife is enchanted with five fiery runes that magically heat its edge. Its sharp blade is intentionally designed to quickly prepare fresh cuts of meat from slain creatures. When you hit with an attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage. In addition, when you reduce a living beast or monstrosity that you can see within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points using this weapon, you can quickly slice off a small, prime cut of its flesh (no action required), cooking it in the process. When you do, you gain 1 ration.
