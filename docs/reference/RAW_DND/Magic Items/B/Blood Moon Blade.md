# [Blood Moon Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444995-blood-moon-blade)

#Weapon *(longsword),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This fine blade is crafted from a strange black metal and bears a hole above the hilt that seems to draw in blood. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a Small or larger living creature with this weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d4 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt in this way. Constructs, plants, and undead creatures are immune to this necrotic damage.

**_Curse._** This sword is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. In addition, while you remain cursed, the number of hit points you regain when healed by magical means (other than the sword’s effect) is halved.
