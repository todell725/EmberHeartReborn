# [Bane Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444984-bane-shield)

#Armor *(shield),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This classic iron shield is emblazoned with the skull-like face of a demon. The shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you while holding this shield, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to curse that creature. The next time that creature makes an ability check or attack roll before the end of its next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total.
