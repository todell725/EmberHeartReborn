# [Bird’s-Eye Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444993-birds-eye-bolt)

#Weapon *(arrow or bolt),* #Common 

As an action, you can fire this piece of magic ammunition into the air above you, causing it to disappear into a dusting of feathers and be destroyed. The ammunition creates an [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) sensor in an unoccupied space that you can see up to 120 feet directly above you. The sensor remains for 1 minute or until you move more than 120 feet away from where you first fired the ammunition. For the duration, you can use an action to see and hear through the sensor as if you were in its space until the start of your next turn. If the ammunition hits a target, it’s no longer magical.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [[See Invisibility]] or [truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight)) sees a luminous, intangible bird about the size of a fist fluttering in the air.
