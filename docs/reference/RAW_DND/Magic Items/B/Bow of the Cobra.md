# [Bow of the Cobra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445010-bow-of-the-cobra)

#Weapon *(any bow),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This metallic bow resembles the shape of a mighty cobra and is covered in spots of patina. When you fire an arrow from the bow, you can choose to coat the arrow in a thin layer of acid. A target hit with the acid-coated arrow takes an extra 1d4 acid damage. Hit or miss, a nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.

In addition, the bow has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect of the [[Melf's Acid Arrow]] spell and uses the same attack bonus as your normal weapon attacks with the bow.
