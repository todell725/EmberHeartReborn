# [Blackthorn Spear of the Moonless Hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444994-blackthorn-spear-of-the-moonless-hunter)

#Weapon *(spear),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This spiny, black bone spear is a favorite among nocturnal hunting tribes. While attuned to the spear, you can always see the faint outline of it, even in total darkness. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This spear contains a fragment of the moonless hunter, an ancient spirit that can be channeled to assume some of its powers. While holding the spear, you can use a bonus action to call forth and assume the spirit of the moonless hunter. While assuming the spirit, your eyes become pure white, and you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the effects of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).
- You can’t sleep or be put to sleep by magical means, and you can’t take or benefit from finishing a long rest.
- You have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.
- You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet.
- You can use a bonus action to cause the spear to fly back to your empty hand or land at your feet (your choice), provided that the spear is within 60 feet of you.
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

You can assume the spirit in this way for up to 8 hours. The effect ends early if you release the spirit as a bonus action or if you’re farther than 60 feet away from the spear for more than 1 minute. The spirit returns to the spear when you are no longer assuming it, at which point you gain 1 level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition)for every 2 hours you assumed the spirit (minimum 1 level). Exhaustion gained in this way can only be reduced by finishing a long rest.
