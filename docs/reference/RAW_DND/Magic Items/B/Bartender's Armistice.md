# [Bartender’s Armistice](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444985-bartenders-armistice)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

A _bartender’s armistice_ is a magical coaster typically kept by wary tavernkeepers for cases of extreme danger. When found, a _bartender’s armistice_ comes in a set of 1d3 + 1 coasters. Each coaster is 4 inches across, and its weight is negligible.

As an action, you can speak the coaster’s command word and throw it at a point on the ground you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, the coaster becomes fixed in place at the point and emits a magical field in a 30-foot-radius, 15-foot-high cylinder that’s centered on it. Each creature within the area must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw when the field appears or when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save, a creature is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you while it remains within the field. A charmed creature is indifferent about creatures it can see that it’s hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell, or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. If you or your companions harm a charmed creature or its friends, the charm ends. When the charm or field ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

When a creature makes an attack or casts a harmful spell that either affects a target within the field or enters or leaves the field’s area, that creature must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attack or spell fails and is expended, and the action is wasted.

Each creature within the field has advantage on any Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check it makes to deescalate a violent situation. In addition, if a creature in the area is [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) when the field appears, it immediately stabilizes if it has 0 hit points.

The coaster has AC 15 and 25 hit points. The field remains for 10 minutes or until the coaster drops to 0 hit points, at which point the coaster is destroyed and the field ends. If the field ends after the full duration, there is a 10 percent chance that the coaster remains magical and can be used again. Otherwise, the coaster becomes nonmagical.
