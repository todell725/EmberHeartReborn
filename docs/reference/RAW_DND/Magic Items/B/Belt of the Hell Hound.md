# [Belt of the Hell Hound](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444992-belt-of-the-hell-hound)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

When you wear this belt, you can feel the fires of the lower planes burn inside you. While wearing the belt, when you make a melee attack against a creature and have advantage on the attack, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage from the attack on a hit.

In addition, while wearing this belt, you can use an action to release a hellish howl. When you do, you exhale a plume of flames from your mouth in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**_Curse._** Once you wear this belt, you can’t remove it unless you are targeted by the [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the belt, you must eat twice the normal amount of food each day (a minimum of 2 pounds) to avoid [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition). In addition, while wearing the belt, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance when you die and again at the end of each hour you remain dead that you immediately immolate and turn to ash.
