#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This deep purple top hat is ringed with a velvet ribbon and secured with leather straps and belts. The hat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 of the hat’s charges and speak its command word, tossing it onto the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. When you do, the hat magically flattens and expands into a purple, circular disk 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick. The disk duplicates the effect of the [[Tenser's Floating Disk]] spell, except that the disk is opaque and remains within 10 feet of you, instead of 20. You can end the spell early using an action to speak the hat’s command word again. When the spell ends, the disk transforms back into the hat.
