An important relic from the early days of the cult known as [[Those Who Watch]]. Currently in the hands of [[Valtteri Valathrax|Val]]. 

The dagger is an aspect of [[Yog-Sothoth]] that was created as a means of spreading their influence at the beginning of their creation. It exists to infiltrate the minds of those who are affected by it. When affected, a person begins to see images and dreams and visions of [[Yog-Sothoth]] themself in their ambiguous form, lurking at the threshold.
