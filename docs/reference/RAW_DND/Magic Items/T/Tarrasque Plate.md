# [Tarrasque Plate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445539-tarrasque-plate)

#Armor *(plate),* #Legendary  *(requires attunement)*

This impenetrable armor is made from refined fragments of a [tarrasque’s](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195232-tarrasque) armored hide and retains some of its original properties. You have resistance to damage from spells and a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you’re targeted by a [[Magic Missile]] spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 6, you are unaffected by the spell, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.
