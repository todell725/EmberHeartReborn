# Topaz Annihilator

#Weapon *(Firearm)*, #Legendary *(Requires Attunement)*

This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a true resurrection or wish spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the [[Disintegrate]] spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
