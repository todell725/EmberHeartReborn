These unusual leg braces are crafted from the legs of a giant cricket. While wearing the braces, your long jump is up to 25 feet and your high jump is up to 15 feet, unless it’s already higher, with or without a running start. Further, your walking speed increases by 5 feet.

In addition, you can use an action to rub your legs together while wearing the braces to create the signature sound of one or many crickets. The sound can be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream.
