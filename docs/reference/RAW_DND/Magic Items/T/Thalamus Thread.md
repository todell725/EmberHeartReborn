# [Thalamus Thread](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445542-thalamus-thread)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This pale gray thread is made from the remains of a powerful mystic’s brain. The overdeveloped organ creates a congealed fiber that, once spun, can be used as a functional bowstring. It’s always oily to the touch and leaves a faint residue on your fingers when pulled. Ranged attacks made with a weapon strung with this thread are considered magical.

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using a bow or crossbow that was strung with this thread, you can speak the thread’s command word as part of the attack to charge the arrow or bolt with psychic power. When you do, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d8 psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature is not stunned. A construct or undead creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw. This property of the thread can’t be used again until the next dawn.
