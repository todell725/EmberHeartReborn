#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare 

This book’s magically charged pages are filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations that teach unique styles of combat. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, you gain one of the following Advanced Fighting Styles:

**_Advanced Simplicity._** Your attacks made with simple weapons score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**_Crushing Blows._** When you score a critical hit using a melee weapon that has the [heavy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Heavy) property, the target takes extra bludgeoning damage equal to 5 + the ability score modifier you used for your attack and damage rolls.

**_Net Mastery._** When you throw a net, its normal and long range is doubled. In addition, the first time that a creature attempts to escape from a net that you threw, the escape DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), unless it’s already higher.

**_Quick Shot._** You gain a special reach with ranged weapons called a firing reach that’s a number of feet equal to 5 + your normal reach. While you are wielding a ranged weapon, other creatures provoke an [opportunity attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack)from you when they move out of your firing reach.

**_Readied Bulwark._** You gain a +2 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks while holding a shield.

**_Versatile Expert._** When you hit with an attack using a weapon that has the [versatile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Versatile) property, you can use the two-handed damage die even if you’re only wielding the weapon with one hand.

You can’t take an Advanced Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Once the book has been used to grant an Advanced Fighting Style, it loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
