# [Tyrannosaurus Rax](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445556-tyrannosaurus-rax)

#Weapon *(greataxe),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This bone-carved axe can channel the might of a rampaging tyrannosaurus rex. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the axe, you can use a bonus action to rampage. While rampaging, you can move through the space of any creature of your size or smaller. When you move through a creature’s space in this way while rampaging, your movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) from that creature for the rest of the turn. Once on each of your turns while rampaging, you can force a creature whose space you move through in this way to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, that creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). In addition, while you’re rampaging, your weapon attacks with this weapon score a critical hit against objects, structures, and prone creatures on a roll of 19 or 20.

Your rampage lasts for up to 1 minute. It ends early if you don’t move through a hostile creature’s space on your turn or if you drop to 0 hit points. This property of the axe can be used twice and regains all expended uses daily at dawn.
