# [Helm of the Ruby Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445218-helm-of-the-ruby-dragon)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement by a dragonborn of neutral alignment)*

This magic gold and ruby helm has been blessed by a powerful, psychic dragon. While wearing this helmet, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks, as well as Intelligence checks made to glean information from an observation or bit of lore. In addition, you can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

When you use your breath weapon while wearing this helmet, you can choose to exhale a blast of pure, concussive force. When you do, your breath weapon deals force damage, instead of its normal damage type, and any creature that fails the saving throw takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage and is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) until the end of your next turn. This property of the helm can’t be used again until the next dawn.
