#Weapon *(greataxe),* #Artifact *(requires attunement by a creature the axe deems worthy)*

This black iron axe was forged in the scorching fires of the Magmarath Caldera and has been the decisive end for countless mortal souls. Used as the mark of a Tribunal in the caldera’s city, the weapon is an embodiment of anger and spite, and has been enchanted with blood magic that bubbles to the surface each time it’s used to end a life. Glimmering veins of lava flicker from its dark metal surface, and roiling, volcanic sparks trail behind it in its wake when swung.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice) to any target it hits. When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, you gain a number of [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to the fire or lightning damage dealt as part of the attack.

**_Explosive Rage._** If you’re a barbarian, the first time you enter a rage after finishing a short or long rest, up to 6 creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 4d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice). In addition, while raging, any creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 1d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice).

**_Fiendish Mind._** You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal while attuned to this weapon.

- 1 minor beneficial property
- 1 major beneficial property

**_Volcanic Immunity._** You are immune to fire damage while attuned to this weapon. In addition, you can stand on and walk across molten rock as if it were solid ground.

**_Sentience._** _Hatred, the Wrathful Edge_ is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common and Infernal.

**_Personality._** The weapon enjoys the sensation of anger. It sees all conflict eventually reaching the same violent conclusion, and encourages its wielder to seek out such hasty and bloody resolutions.

**_Destroying the Axe._** The only way to destroy the axe is to dispel the malevolent spirit within it over time from the Upper Planes. Casting [[Dispel Evil and Good]] on the weapon every day for 5 years while on an [[Upper Planes|Upper Plane]] causes the wrathful spirit within it to eventually succumb and perish. When the spirit leaves the axe, it loses all of its properties except for its bonus to attack and damage rolls, but becomes no harder to destroy than a normal magic weapon.
