#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon *(requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This red hat is worn by a coven of witches known for their familiarity with death’s doorstep. While wearing this hat, you can cast the [[Chill Touch]] spell at will. Whenever you have 0 hit points while wearing this hat, you gain the following benefits:

- You stabilize or die after your sixth successful or failed death saving throw, instead of your third, but only succeed on the saving throw on a roll of 15 or higher.
- When you roll a death saving throw, you can immediately cause the hat to cast the _chill touch_ spell (+5 to hit, no action required) against a creature within 30 feet of you that isn’t behind [total cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover) or [heavily obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#VisionandLight). If it hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw.
