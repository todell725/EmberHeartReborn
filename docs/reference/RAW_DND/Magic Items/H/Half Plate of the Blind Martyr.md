While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC, spellcasting ability modifier, and spell attack bonus:

- 1 charge: [[Cure Wounds]], [[Inflict Wounds]]

- 6 charges: [[Harm]], [[Heal]]

**_Curse._** This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. This curse can only be removed by a [[Wish]] spell or similar magic, removing the armor fails to end the curse. While you’re cursed, you are blind, but have [blindsight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Blindsight) out to a range of 60 feet while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
