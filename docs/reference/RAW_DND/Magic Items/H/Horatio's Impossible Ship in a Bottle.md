# [Horatio’s Impossible Ship in a Bottle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445226-horatios-impossible-ship-in-a-bottle)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This sea-tumbled glass bottle has a miniature sailing ship assembled inside it. The bottle weighs 1 pound and is magically sealed with red wax. Despite there being no wind in the bottle, the vessel’s sails seemingly billow and turn on their own.

You can speak the bottle’s command word to cause the wax to come apart and open the bottle. When the open bottle is submerged in a large enough body of water, the ship inside it magically slips out, destroying the bottle, and becomes a sailing ship 50 feet long and 15 feet wide. A crew of 10 [[Unseen Servant|Unseen Servants]] remain on the ship at all times and can be commanded by you or any creature that is friendly to you while on board to adjust the ship’s sails and direction. The ship’s reduced size halves the vessel’s normal creature and cargo capacity, but is otherwise treated as if it were a normal sailing ship.

If you keep a similarly sized glass bottle aboard the vessel, the ship and its unseen crew magically reduce in size and appear inside the newly sealed bottle when the ship is run aground. The bottle must have been submerged in the ocean for at least 10 years, and anything onboard the ship when it is resealed falls to the water or ground below.
