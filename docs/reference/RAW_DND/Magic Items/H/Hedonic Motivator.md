#Weapon *(whip),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This magic whip once belonged to an especially controlling [succubus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4904865-succubus) or [incubus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4904793-incubus). The whip has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to lash out with it against a friendly creature within 10 feet of you. That creature gains one of the following benefits of your choice:

- The creature gains 2d4 + 4 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints), which last for 1 minute.
- The creature can add 1d4 + 2 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
