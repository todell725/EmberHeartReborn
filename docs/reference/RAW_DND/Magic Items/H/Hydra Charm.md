# [Hydra Charm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445234-hydra-charm)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement)*

This golden talisman is made of five twisting hydra heads and hung from a simple gold chain. While wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits:

- When you use your reaction to make an [opportunity attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack), you can make a second attack against that same target as part of that reaction.
- You can make an opportunity attack, even if you’ve already used your reaction.
- When you are forced to make a saving throw against being [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition), or knocked [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition), you can use your reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.
- When you take more than 25 damage from a single attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.
- When your head would be cut off by an effect, such as by a [[Vorpal Sword]], you can use your reaction to negate the effect.

Once a benefit of the talisman has been used, that benefit can’t be used again until you finish a long rest.
