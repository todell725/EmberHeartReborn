#Weapon *(any hammer),* *Rarity Varies* *(Requires Attunement)*

*Humblemaker* is a thick, rune-inscribed maul forged from celestial bronze and star-forged iron. Its haft is wrapped in stormhide leather, and the twin heads of the hammer glow faintly with a metallic sheen. Despite its massive size, it feels perfectly balanced in the hands of one who is attuned to it. The hammer is said to be a leftover relic of an ancient civilization of Giants who have long since died out.
