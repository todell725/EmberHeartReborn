#Wondrousus *Item*, #Uncommon

A _Hag Eye_ has 3 charges. While wearing or holding this item, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619082-darkvision) (targeting yourself only) or [[See Invisibility]]. The _Hag Eye_ regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

**_Coven Sensor._** The _Hag Eye_ is usually entrusted to a hag’s minion for safekeeping and transport. As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, a hag who belongs to the coven that created the _Hag Eye_ can see what the _Hag Eye_ sees if the hag and the _Hag Eye_ are on the same plane of existence. This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). Multiple hags in the coven can see through the _Hag Eye_ simultaneously.

**_Creating a Hag Eye._** Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one _Hag Eye_ at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can’t perform it if one or more of them has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends.
