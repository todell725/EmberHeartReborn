# [Hideaway Vase](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445219-hideaway-vase)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This durable, ceramic vase is 3 feet tall and weighs 15 pounds. You can use an action to remove the vase’s lid. When you do, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be shunted onto a harmless demiplane inside the vase. A Large or larger creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but a willing Medium or smaller creature can choose to fail it. If a creature is already on the demiplane when you remove the lid, that creature reappears in the nearest unoccupied space, and you automatically succeed on the saving throw. Immediately after opening the vase in this way, the lid flies back and reseals the vase.

While on this demiplane, you can’t move and are [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), but can hear everything outside of the vase as if you were standing in its space. You can leave this demiplane using an action to reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. When you attempt to leave the demiplane, a creature outside the vase can use its reaction to hold the vase’s lid shut and make a DC 25 Strength check, preventing you from leaving on a success.

The vase has AC 12, 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. The vase is destroyed if it drops to 0 hit points. If the vase is destroyed while a creature is on its demiplane, that creature is forced into the nearest unoccupied space. Once a creature leaves the demiplane, the vase’s lid can’t be removed again for 24 hours.

You can remain on the demiplane for up to 8 hours or until the vase is placed inside an extradimensional space created by a [[Bag of Holding]], [[Portable Hole]], or similar item, at which time you are forcefully shunted out of it. If the lid is successfully held in place when you would be forcefully shunted from the demiplane in this way, the vase shatters and is destroyed.

While holding the vase, you can use an action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the vessel. The vase’s weight doesn’t change. Regardless of its appearance, the vase can’t be anything but a vase.
