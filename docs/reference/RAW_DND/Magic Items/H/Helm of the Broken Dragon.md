# [Helm of the Broken Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445214-helm-of-the-broken-dragon)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement by a non-lawful dragonborn)*

This helmet is made of harsh, angular shapes that come together into the shape of an aberrant dragon skull. Your scales twist into strange, fractal-like patterns tinged with otherworldly colors when you attune to this item. While wearing the helmet, you have resistance to psychic damage, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks against you. In addition, your breath weapon changes to be a plume of unearthly psionic energy, dealing psychic damage instead of its normal damage type. A creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw, instead of your breath weapon’s normal save. On a failed save, a creature is also affected as by the [[Bane (spell)]] spell for 1 minute as maddening whispers fill its mind. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your breath weapon DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**_Curse._** This helmet is cursed with gnawing insecurity and self-doubt. Attuning to the helmet curses you until you are targeted by the [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic. While cursed, you are unwilling to remove the helm, and you gain the following flaw: *“Whatever course of action I take, there is a voice in my head that screams at me to do the opposite. The voice is never silent.”*
