# [Hushed Ring](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445233-hushed-ring)

#Ring, #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This ring creates an arcane field around you that prevents certain modes of communication. While wearing this ring, you cannot be spoken to telepathically by creatures other than the ones you choose.

In addition, while wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak this ring’s command word to create an aura of silence around you. The aura affects creatures other than yourself within 10 feet of you. It remains as long as you [concentrate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. For the duration, when a creature within the aura attempts to speak or utter the verbal components of a spell, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak or produce the verbal components of a spell until the start of its next turn, and any action, bonus action, or reaction it used to do so is wasted. This property of the ring can’t be used again until the next dusk.
