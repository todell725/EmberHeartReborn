#Weapon *(dagger),* #Legendary *(requires attunement)*

This ornate dagger is made of multiple pieces that magically hover together, but move as if they were solidly connected. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to any creature it hits. This extra damage increases to 4d4 radiant damage if the creature is a fiend or undead.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a fiend, the target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished, as if by the [[Banishment]] spell. This version of the spell doesn’t require [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) but ends early if you become [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) or die within the next minute. On a successful save, the creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition)until the start of your next turn and isn’t banished.
