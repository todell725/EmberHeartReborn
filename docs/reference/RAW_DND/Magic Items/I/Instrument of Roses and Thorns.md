# [Instrument of Roses and Thorns](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445242-instrument-of-roses-and-thorns)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare *(requires attunement by a bard)*

This string instrument is ornamented with rose and thorn designs. Whenever you use this instrument to give a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature, you can also choose to force another creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature gains an Enervation die, which remains for 1 minute or until it’s rolled. When a creature with one or more Enervation dice that you can see makes an ability check or attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll any number of its Enervation dice, which are the same as your Bardic Inspiration dice, and subtract the result from the total of the roll. The Enervation dice are then lost. You can wait to use this reaction until after the creature rolls the d20, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If the total of the roll is reduced to 0 or lower as a result of the Enervation die, the creature also takes 6d6 necrotic damage.

A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage.
