# [Underworld Asphodel Regalia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445557-underworld-asphodel-regalia)

#Wondrous *item,* #Legendary *(requires attunement by a cleric or wizard)*

This set of royal finery was worn by a noble necromancer with a unique appreciation for the quality of life that extends beyond death. Asphodel blossoms, representing life beyond the tomb, ornament this enchanted outfit. The lush flowers in its laurel crown are nestled among long-dead leaves.

While wearing the regalia, you can cast the [[Animate Dead]] spell from it over the course of 1 minute. You can use this property a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses daily at dusk. When you create an undead using a necromancy spell, the creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

**_Chthonic Command._** As an action, you can issue a command of either dismissal or obedience to an undead creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature immune to features that turn undead automatically succeeds on the saving throw. On a failed save, you can impose one of the following effects on that creature for 1 minute:

- The creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move into a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action. This effect ends early if that creature takes any damage.
- The creature is [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by you. While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. Each time the creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect ends.

You can use this property a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You regain all expended uses daily at dusk.

**_Ruler of the Dead._** You are always under the effects of the [[Sanctuary]] spell. This version of the spell only affects undead. If you make an attack or cast a spell that affects an undead creature, that creature is immune to this spell’s effects for 24 hours.
