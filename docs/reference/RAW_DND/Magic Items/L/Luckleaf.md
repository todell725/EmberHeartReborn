#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This plant is commonly thought to be a special kind of clover. However, a luckleaf is a separate, magical species that grows in random locations across the [[Material Plane]] and has 5 leaves. While a _luckleaf_ is on your person, you can choose to expend any number of its leaves (no action required). When you do so, you gain a +1 bonus or take a –1 penalty to any roll you make for each expended leaf. This bonus or penalty can’t change the total result beyond the highest or lowest number possible for the die you rolled. You can wait to use this property until after seeing the total of the roll, but before the GM determines the outcome of it. An expended leaf withers and turns to dust. When the last leaf is expended, the plant becomes a nonmagical stem.
