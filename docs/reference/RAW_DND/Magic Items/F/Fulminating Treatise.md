This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[Contingency]], [[Fireball]], [[Gust of Wind]], [[Leomund's Tiny Hut]], [[Magic Missile]], [[Thunderwave]], and [[Wall of Force]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.
- When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d6 force damage to the creature and knock the creature [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) if it is Large or smaller.
