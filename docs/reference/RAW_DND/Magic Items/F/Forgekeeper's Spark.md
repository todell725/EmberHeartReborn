# [Forgekeeper’s Spark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445141-forgekeepers-spark)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

A lingering fragment of a fire spirit remains attached to this piece of coal, keeping it covered in harmless blue embers that are pleasantly warm to the touch. When surrounded by fire, the coal burns with a magical blue flame and the spirit within it emerges. The spirit remains until the fire goes out or is doused, at which point the spirit hides within its coal until immersed in flames once more. If removed from the fire, the spirit moves with the burning coal and remains for up to 1 minute.

While the spirit is present, it helps tend to the fire it’s placed in. The spirit can maintain a fire that fills up to a 5-foot cube. A fire tended to by the spirit gains the following benefits:

- It can’t be extinguished by strong winds.
- It produces no smoke, unless you want it to.
- It burns for twice the normal duration with the same amount of fuel.
- Any food being cooked in the fire is kept at an ideal temperature.

In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses either cook’s utensils or glassblower’s, smith’s, or tinker’s tools to heat and craft items in the fire. If you roll a 15 or higher on the d20, the time it takes to use the tools in this way is halved.
