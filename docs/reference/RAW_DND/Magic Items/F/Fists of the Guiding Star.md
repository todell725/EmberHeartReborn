#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a monk)*

Stars and celestial bodies glimmer through these hand wrappings. While wearing these wraps over your hands, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 ki point to cause small motes of starlight to guide a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, giving it advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn. If that creature’s next attack hits, the attack deals extra radiant damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[Light]] cantrip while wearing these wraps.
