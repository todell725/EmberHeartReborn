# [Faeflame Torch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445127-faeflame-torch)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This magic torch was harvested from a tree in the Safire Wood, one of the most beautiful and deadly fey forests. While holding the torch, you can use a bonus action to speak its first command word, causing eerie blue flames to appear above the head of the torch. The flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The flames are not extinguished when immersed in water and last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you stow the torch.

You can use an action while holding the lit torch to speak its second or third command word. Speaking the second command word causes any illusion within the torch’s bright light to be outlined in blue, green, or violet (your choice) for 1 minute. The torch can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

Speaking the third command word causes the flame to fly from the torch and erupt at a point you can see within 60 feet of you, creating an explosion of blue flames and duplicating the effect of the [[Faerie Fire]] spell (save DC 15, no [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) required) in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. A creature also takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can choose to end the effect early as a bonus action. When the effect ends, the flame reappears above the torch. The torch can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
