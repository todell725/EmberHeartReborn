# [Fused Chimeric Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445151-fused-chimeric-hide)

#Armor *(hide),* #Rare *(requires attunement by a barbarian or druid)*

This armor is made from the three unique hides of a fearsome [chimera](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194943-chimera), creating an armor that’s both imposing and practical. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

In addition, when you enter a rage or use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast, you can take on a special aspect, choosing one of the options below.

**_Aspect of the Dragon._** Your skin hardens into plate-like scales, granting you 20 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) and resistance to fire damage.

**_Aspect of the Goat._** You grow a pair of ram’s horns. If you already have horns, this aspect causes them to grow larger and more powerful. When you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target no more than one size larger than you and immediately make a melee weapon attack against it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).

**_Aspect of the Lion._** You grow a shimmering mane that wreathes your head and neck, and your teeth become fangs. You have advantage on melee attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition).

Each aspect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, you revert to your normal form or beast shape. Once you take on the aspect of a creature in this way, you can’t take on that aspect again until the next dawn.
