# [Feywood Ivy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445132-feywood-ivy)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a druid, ranger, or fey creature)*

This tiny seed has a glowing rune on its shell. While holding the seed against a weapon or similar held object, you can speak its first command word as an action to cause the seed to sprout and cover the object with green and purple vines. The vines form a comfortable grip with which to hold the object and also create a protective cover for it, such as a sheath or carrying case, that automatically stows the object while it isn’t being held, unless you decide for it not to. You can use an action to speak the first command word again to cause the vines to retreat from the object and return to the seed.

While an object is covered by the vines, you can’t be disarmed of that object unless you are [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). In addition, the object can be used as a spellcasting focus for you.

While the vine-covered object is on your person, you can use a bonus action to speak the vines’ second command word to cause them to lash out at a Medium or smaller target that you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) for 1 minute. While grappled, the target is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) and can use an action on each of its turns to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself and ending the effect on a success. The effect ends early and frees the target if you move more than 5 feet away from it. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
