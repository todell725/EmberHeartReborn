# [Forgework Dragon Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445142-forgework-dragon-shield)

#Armor *(shield),* #Rare 

While holding this plated brass shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. The shield has a metallic maw in the visage of a dragon forged into the face of the shield, and small plumes of flame occasionally leap from openings in the shield’s plates.

When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to retaliate with the shield. When you do, a gout of flame erupts from the shield, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 fire damage and ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t ignite. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
