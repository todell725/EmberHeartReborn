# [Fool’s Lamp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445139-fools-lamp)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare 

This brass lamp is decorated with flowing patterns around a blue, glass chamber at its center. Swirling, magenta clouds drift within the lamp and billow eagerly whenever it’s held. Created as a grim sculpture by a spiteful [djinni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194971-djinni), this lamp offers no benefit to those foolish enough to encounter it.

An [[Identify]] or [[Legend Lore]] spell correctly reveals the lamp to be empty, as well as its true nature. However, identifying the lamp by any other means will reveal that the lamp has a djinni trapped inside it, allowing it to function as a [[Ring of Djinni Summoning]] while held and without requiring attunement. It also reveals that the only way to summon the djinni is to ask it for a wish (such as a [[Wish]] spell or general command), treating the wish as a command phrase.

When a creature holding the lamp speaks such a phrase using an action, the GM uses the table below to choose the outcome or determine it randomly:

| d10    | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **1**  | You’re shunted to a harmless demiplane inside the lamp for 1 hour, during which time you can see as if you were in the lamp’s space, but are otherwise [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) and [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition). At the end of each of your turns while you’re in the demiplane, you can make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. At the end of the duration, you return to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the lamp. |
| **2**  | A [[Fireball]] (5th-level version, save DC 16) erupts, centered on you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **3**  | You’re unintelligible for 2d6 hours, during which time you only speak in nonsensical sounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **4**  | You’re under the effect of the [[Faerie Fire]] spell for 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **6**  | Your legs become unstable for 1d6 hours, during which time you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, and if you move your full speed on a turn, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity check or fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **7**  | You’re affected by the [[Levitate]] spell for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, flip a coin and roll a d4. If it’s heads, you float up a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the d4. If it’s tails, you float down the same number of feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **8**  | You are under the effect of the [[Suggestion]] spell for 1d6 hours. If you are asked to do something that isn’t harmful, accompanied by the word “please” or a similar phrase, you are compelled to obey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **9**  | You age 1d10 years, taking 5 necrotic damage for each year that you age in this way. Your age returns to normal when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **10** | Roll twice on the table and use both effects, rerolling any 10s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If a creature affected by the lamp is targeted by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or similar magic, one of the lamp’s effects on the creature ends.
