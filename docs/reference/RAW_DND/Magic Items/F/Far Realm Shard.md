# [Far Realm Shard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2412226-far-realm-shard)

#Wondrous *item*, #Rare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the [[Far Realm]]. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d6 psychic damage and become [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) of you until the start of your next turn.
