#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This jewel-encrusted pauldron has the distinct appearance of a large conch shell. While wearing this pauldron, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

While worn, the pauldron releases a thin veil of illusory water, creating a small, watery cape behind you. While wearing it, you can use an action to speak its command word to cause the water to become real. When you do, the water pours from the shell in a flooding torrent that extends from you to form a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of water that moves with you and remains centered on the ground beneath you. The cylinder lasts as long as you [concentrate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 10 minutes. However, if you move in such a way that causes you to leave the cylinder, such as by swimming upward and climbing out of it, the effect ends.

Any creature other than you in the cylinder when it appears must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed away from you to the nearest unoccupied space outside of the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

Once this property of the pauldron has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
