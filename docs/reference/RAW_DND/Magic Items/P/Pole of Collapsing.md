#Wondrous *Item*, #Common

This item functions as a [Pole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/400-pole). While holding it, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole’s weight doesn’t change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
