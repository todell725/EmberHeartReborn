# [Pack of Revisibility Bombs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445359-pack-of-revisibility-bombs)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

A _pack of revisibility bombs_ typically includes 1d3 + 3 fist-sized bombs when found. You can use an action to throw a bomb at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The bomb explodes at the point where it impacts, destroying the bomb and releasing a dispelling vapor in a cloud around it. When the bomb explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes visible if it isn’t already, and can’t become [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) for 1 minute. Objects within the area that aren’t being worn or carried automatically become visible if they’re invisible and can’t become invisible for 1 minute.
