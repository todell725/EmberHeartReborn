# [Prying Mace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445391-prying-mace)

#Weapon *(mace),* #Uncommon 

This mace was used by ruthless inquisitors during the Upheaval, a century-long war against magical secrets. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a living creature with an Intelligence of 6 or higher that speaks at least one language, you immediately learn what the last lie was that it told. You don’t learn the truth behind the lie, only the phrase or phrases that were used when telling it. If the phrase is in a language you don’t understand, you still learn the phrase, but not its meaning.
