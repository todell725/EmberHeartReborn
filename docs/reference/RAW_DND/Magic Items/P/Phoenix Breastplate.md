# [Phoenix Breastplate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445372-phoenix-breastplate)

#Armor *(breastplate),* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement)*

This golden breastplate has the shape of a phoenix worked into its design. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.

When you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, a fiery explosion surrounds you. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You and other friendly creatures within the area regain a number of hit points equal to the same amount, instead of taking fire damage. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t be used again until 1d6 + 1 days have passed.
