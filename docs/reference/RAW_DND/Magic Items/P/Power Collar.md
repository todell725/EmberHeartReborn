# [Power Collar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445388-power-collar)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This spiked leather collar is adjustable in size and has a buckle on its side in the shape of a bear’s head. You can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly beast companion or a familiar (such as one summoned by the [[Find Familiar]] spell), you can speak the collar’s command word as part of this action to create a magical bond between you and the creature. The bond remains until the collar is removed. While the bonded creature is wearing the collar, its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your character level.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the collar’s command word while you can see the bonded creature within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature gains the effect of the Enlarge option from the [[Enlarge Reduce]] spell (no [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) required). Alternatively, if you drop to 0 hit points while the bonded creature is within 30 feet of you, it can use its reaction to gain the spell’s effect instead. Once this property of the collar has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.

If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the [[Polymorph]] spell or similar magic, the bond fails when you speak the command word and the collar has no effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned by the [[Find Familiar]] spell, the collar and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of one magical collar at a time.
