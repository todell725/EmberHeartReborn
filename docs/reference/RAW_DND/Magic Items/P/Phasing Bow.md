# [Phasing Bow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445366-phasing-bow)

#Weapon *(any bow),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This flexible bow is made from the chitinous legs of a [phase spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195158-phase-spider) and retains some of its ethereal properties. When you hit with a ranged attack using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d4 force damage.

The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the arrow to slip partially into the Ethereal Plane. When you do, the target of the attack gains no benefit from cover, including [total cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover), as long as the cover isn’t made of lead or more than 1 foot thick. If you hit, the target takes an extra 3d4 force damage. Any effect that blocks travel through the Ethereal Plane also blocks the arrow.

Alternatively, you can speak the bow’s command word as a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges and fire an arrow at a point you can see within the weapon’s normal range. When the arrow hits a solid surface, you vanish from your location and reappear in an unoccupied space nearest to that point.
