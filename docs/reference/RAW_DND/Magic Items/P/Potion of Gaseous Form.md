#Potion, #Rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Gaseous Form]] spell for 1 hour (no [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a Bonus Action.

This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
