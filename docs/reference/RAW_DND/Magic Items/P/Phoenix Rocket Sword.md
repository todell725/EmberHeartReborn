# [Phoenix Rocket Sword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445373-phoenix-rocket-sword)

#Weapon *(greatsword),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This heavy, steel greatsword creates a powerful fan of flames from curious, whirring chambers mounted to the blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

As an action, you can hold the sword out in front of you and speak its command word to expend up to 5 of its charges, causing a jet of flame to erupt from it. When you do, the sword emits a roar that’s audible out to 100 feet, and you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 20 feet for each charge you expend. You can choose to fail this saving throw, whose DC equals 10 + the number of charges you expend. This movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack). Pointing the blade down and expending charges in this way launches you upward instead. If you do and you are not launched, the sword’s flames spread out in a 15-foot-radius circle, centered on you.

The jet of flame spreads out in a 15-foot cone and moves with you if you’re pushed. Any creature in the area when the flame first appears or when it moves into the creature’s space must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as much fire damage on a success. The fire damage increases by 1d6 for each additional charge you expend beyond the first.

If you strike an object because of this forced movement, such as a wall or floor, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every charge you expend and are knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). If you strike a creature, you and that creature take the same bludgeoning damage and must each succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 10 + the number of charges you expend) or be knocked prone.
