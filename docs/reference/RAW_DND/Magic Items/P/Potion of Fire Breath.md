# [Potion of Fire Breath](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5357-potion-of-fire-breath)

#Potion, #Uncommon

After drinking this potion, you can take a Bonus Action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

This potion’s orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
