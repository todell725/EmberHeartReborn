# [Pegasus Quill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445360-pegasus-quill)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

The feather adorning this quill was a gift from a mighty pegasus and has a beautiful, pearlescent shimmer. When you write with this magic quill, the time it takes for you to write something, such as copying a spell into a spellbook or creating a spell scroll, is halved.
