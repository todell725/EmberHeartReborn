# [Potion of Longevity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5359-potion-of-longevity)

#Potion, #VeryRare

When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a #Potion of Longevity_, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years.

Suspended in this amber liquid is a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
