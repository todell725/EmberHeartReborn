# Planar Essence

#Wondrous  *item*, #VeryRare *(Requires Attunement)*

A Planar Essence is a magical item that contains some of the energy of the plane from which it originates. Planar Essences come into being when the [[Material Plane]] overlaps somehow with another plane. For example, during the [[Spellplague]] the [[Feywild|Feywild]] became more accessible to folks on the [[Material Plane]] due to the shifting of the [[The Weave]] and the weird magic that was triggered. When this happened, a number of Feywild Essences were created. These slivers of the [[Feywild|Feywild]] trapped themselves inside of ordinary objects, like a pinecone, or a tome of children's stories. 

As the DM, use your judgment to determine what magical effect can be utilized by a character possessing a Planar Essence. Ensure that the magical effect is indicative of the plane from which it originates. For instance, a Far Realm Essence may allow a character to cast [[Evard's Black Tentacles]], while a Hellish Essence may allow a character to cast [[Hellish Rebuke]]. Some powerful Essences may allow for others effects, like a Feywild Essence allowing its owner to open a Fey Crossing.
