# [Pollinator Pants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445385-pollinator-pants)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

While wearing this pair of black-and-yellow striped pants, any flower you move within 5 feet of magically blossoms, as if by the [[Druidcraft]] spell.

The pants have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the pants, you can use an action to expend 1 of their charges to cast the [[Speak with Plants]] spell from them. This version of the spell only affects plants within the spell’s range that have at least one flower on them. When you speak with a plant in this way, you do so by making a combination of somatic gestures and dance-like steps, rather than using your voice. These movements come naturally to you for the duration of the spell and magically convey your message.

**_Beekeeper’s Commitment._** While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the pants regain all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gain the following benefit:

**_Sting._** When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make a special unarmed strike against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage from the attack. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this unarmed strike, the target takes an extra 10 poison damage from the attack and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) until the end of your next turn.
