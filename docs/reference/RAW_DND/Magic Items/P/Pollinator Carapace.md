# [Pollinator Carapace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445384-pollinator-carapace)

#Armor *(leather, studded leather, or hide),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This black and yellow armor has a billowing plume of soft fur around its neck and chest. Draped over its shoulders is a scalloped cape that’s split into two translucent, wing-like ends.

The armor has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to activate the cape, transforming it into a pair of insect-like wings for 1 hour. For the duration of the wings, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

**_Beekeeper’s Commitment._** While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:

**_Pollinator._** While the armor’s cape is transformed, it releases a sparkling mist of enchanting pollen. For the duration, any insect or plant creature that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.
