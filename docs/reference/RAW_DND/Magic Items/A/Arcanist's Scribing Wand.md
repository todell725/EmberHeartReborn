# [Arcanist’s Scribing Wand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9444970-arcanists-scribing-wand)

#Wand, #Rare *(requires attunement by a wizard)*

This wand’s handle has a fountain pen nib at its end that releases its own magical ink. When you use this pen to copy a spell into your spellbook, the gold it takes to do so is halved. Swinging the wand causes tiny droplets of illusory ink to trail behind it.

The wand has 7 charges for the following properties:

**_Spells._** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: [[Comprehend Languages]] (written language only) or [[Illusory Script]].

**_Cloudscript._** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to cause up to 10 words to appear in the sky. The words are formed from wisps of clouds or smoke (your choice) and remain in place as long as you [concentrate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses them.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand dissolves into a puddle of mundane ink and is destroyed.
