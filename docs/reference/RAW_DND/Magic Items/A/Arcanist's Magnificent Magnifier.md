#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This magical magnifying glass helps deduce the arcane nature of items. While looking through the glass at an object within 1 foot of you, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check you make regarding that object’s magical properties. In addition, you can speak the glass’s command word as an action to cast the [[Identify]] spell from it, targeting an object with the spell that you can see through the glass within 1 foot of you. Each time you do, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the glass shatters and is destroyed after casting the spell.
