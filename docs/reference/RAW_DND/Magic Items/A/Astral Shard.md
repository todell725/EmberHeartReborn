# [Astral Shard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2374941-astral-shard)

 #Wondrous *item*, #Rare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This crystal is a solidified shard of the [[Astral Plane]], swirling with silver mist. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, immediately after casting the spell you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.
