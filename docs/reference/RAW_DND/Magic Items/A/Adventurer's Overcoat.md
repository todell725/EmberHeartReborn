#Wondrous  *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This well-traveled and now faded overcoat has been worn by countless other mountaineering adventurers. A thin layer of frost hangs along the coat’s hem. While wearing the coat, you and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to cold damage.
