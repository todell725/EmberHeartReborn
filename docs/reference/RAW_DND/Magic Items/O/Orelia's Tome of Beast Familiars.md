#Wondrous *item,* #Rare  *(requires attunement by a wizard)*

While attuned to this book, you always have the [[Find Familiar]] spell prepared. This spell doesn’t count against the number of spells you have prepared.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, your familiar can take on the form of stronger animals. The spell slot level determines what beasts your familiar can take the form of, as shown in the table below.

| Spell Slot Level | Max CR |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| **2**                | 1/8    |
| **3–4**              | 1/4    |
| **5–6**              | 1/2    |
| **7–8**              | 1      |
| **9**                | 2      |

In addition, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, it requires an extra 10 gp worth of material components for each slot level above 1st. If your attunement to the book ends, any familiar you have disappears, leaving behind no physical form.
