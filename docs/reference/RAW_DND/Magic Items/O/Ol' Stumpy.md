#Weapon *(maul),* #Uncommon 

This lashed-together stump and stick carry an age-old enchantment from an unknown source. Over time, the strength of the magic has faded, but this heirloom of a weapon has remained in caring hands all the while. Creatures hit with this magic weapon take an extra 1d4 poison damage. If the creature is fey, you deal maximum poison damage instead of rolling.
