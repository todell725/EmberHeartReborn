# [Outer Essence Shard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2405522-outer-essence-shard)

#Wondrous *item*, #Rare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a d4 and consult the Outer Essence Shards table to determine the shard’s essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.
