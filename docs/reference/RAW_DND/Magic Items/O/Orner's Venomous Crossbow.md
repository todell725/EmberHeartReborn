# [Orner’s Venomous Crossbow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445353-orners-venomous-crossbow)

#Weapon *(crossbow, hand),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This magic crossbow carries a small system of curious tubes and vessels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The crossbow has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon’s charges when you make an attack with it to coat the fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) until the end of its next turn.

If you expend the crossbow’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the vessels attached to the crossbow shatter and spray poison in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on your location. Creatures within the sphere take 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) for 1 minute. When this happens, the crossbow ceases to be magical and loses all of its additional properties.
