# [Oathkeeper’s Resolve](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445347-oathkeepers-resolve)

#Armor *(shield),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement by a paladin)*

This star-shaped mithral buckler weighs 2 pounds and bolsters your sense of holy purpose. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.

The center of the shield is ornamented with a durable, glassy lens that can project your holy radiance. You can use a bonus action while holding this shield to cause it to emit bright light from the lens in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to extinguish it or until you drop to 0 hit points.

**_Radiant Aura._** When you doff this shield or by using an action, you can speak the shield’s command word and choose to throw it to a friendly creature (if it has a free hand) or unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see, causing the shield to radiate with your holy resolve and light. The shield’s light becomes suffused with divine intention, casting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet instead of its normal radius. This holy light lasts for 1 minute, and any friendly creature within the bright light gains the effects of your paladin auras. Completely covering the affected shield with an opaque object blocks the light. Once the holy light fades, this property can’t be used again for 8 hours.
