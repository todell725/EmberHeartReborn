# [Owlbear Leather Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445358-owlbear-leather-armor)

#Armor *(leather),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This set of leather armor was made from the remains of a hardy and ferocious [owlbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195152-owlbear). While wearing this armor, if you fail a Constitution saving throw against an effect from a hostile source, you can choose to succeed instead. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
