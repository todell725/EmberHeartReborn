# [Wand of Dowsing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445587-wand-of-dowsing)

#Wand, #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This hazel wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[Locate Object]] spell from it. When the wand is used to detect water, its range increases to 10 miles.

The wand regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into a small cloud of harmless steam.
