#Wand, #Common

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.

**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
