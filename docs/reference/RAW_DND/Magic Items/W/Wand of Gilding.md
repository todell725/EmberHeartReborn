# [Wand of Gilding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445588-wand-of-gilding)

#Wand, #Rare  *(requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This golden wand is a classic royal family heirloom and has a delicate lily at its end that flowers when held. While holding the wand, you can use the following properties:

**_Enhance Beauty._** You can use an action to point the wand at a living target you can see within 30 feet of you and magically enhance its beauty for 1 hour. If the target is a creature, its eyelashes may become thicker, its skin more radiant, and its hair more luscious. If it’s a plant, it may grow more vibrant, smell more fragrant, and look visibly healthier.

**_Gild._** As an action, you can touch the wand to a target no larger than 1 foot in any dimension to cause it to appear to be made of gold for 1 hour. Its appearance and texture change to reflect the new appearance, but its weight remains the same. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check reveals that the effect is illusory. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dirt and is destroyed.

**_Spells._** While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): [[Alter Self]] (Change Appearance only), [[Charm Person]] (2nd-level version), [[Enthrall]], or [[Hypnotic Pattern]].

**_Silver Tongue._** While holding this wand, when you make a Charisma check or saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend 1 of its charges to make the roll with advantage.
