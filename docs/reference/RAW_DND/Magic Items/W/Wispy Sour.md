#Potion, #Common  *or* #Uncommon 

The typical [wispy sour](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445650-wispy-sour-common), a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes you to float harmlessly off the floor. When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet for 1 minute, but can only hover 1 foot above the ground when doing so. The drink is smooth, sweet, and has a slight aftertaste of ash. A tiny, single light from the [[Dancing Lights]] spell is often cast within the drink when served. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

The following [wispy sour](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445651-wispy-sour-uncommon) is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.

For 1 minute after drinking this potion, you can regain 1d8 + 2 hit points once on each of your turns when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points. If the creature is a construct or undead, you don’t regain any hit points in this way. This variant contains a harmless will-o’-wisp fragment. Hazy visions of lost souls occasionally drift through the drink’s cheery liquid.
