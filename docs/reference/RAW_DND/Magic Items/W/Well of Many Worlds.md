# [Well of Many Worlds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229200-well-of-many-worlds)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Legendary

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to unfold the _Well of Many Worlds_ and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

Once the _Well of Many Worlds_ has opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.
