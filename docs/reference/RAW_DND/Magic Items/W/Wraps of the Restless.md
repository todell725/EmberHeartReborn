# [Wraps of the Restless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445653-wraps-of-the-restless)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement)*

These salvaged wrappings from the arms of a mummy lord hang loosely from your arms but never seem to slide off. While wearing the wraps, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

In addition, when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action while wearing the wraps, you can use a bonus action immediately before or after one of your attacks to cause a piece of the wrapping to lash out at a target within 10 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack for the wrapping, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage.

The wraps have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can hold out your hand and expend 1 or more of the wraps’ charges to release a blast of sand from it in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition)until the start of your next turn, and for each charge you spend, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 necrotic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

**_Curse._** Once you don these cursed wraps, you can’t doff them unless you are targeted by the [[Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic. While wearing the wraps, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against undead and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. In addition, while cursed, you don’t recover as much from resting. When you roll Hit Dice to regain hit points, roll each one of the dice twice and use the lower result.
