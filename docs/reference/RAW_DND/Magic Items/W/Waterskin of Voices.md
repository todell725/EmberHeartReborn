# [Waterskin of Voices](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445602-waterskin-of-voices)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This leather waterskin has a magical beverage inside that allows you to briefly alter your voice. When found, the waterskin has 1d6 + 4 servings. You can drink 1 of the servings while holding the waterskin using an action. When you do, choose a voice from a creature you’ve heard or one from your imagination. The next 25 words you speak within 10 minutes sound virtually indistinguishable from the voice you chose, though a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check reveals that the voice is magically altered. If the voice you chose belongs to another creature, that creature automatically knows that the voice is altered.
