# [Wyrmling Wristlet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445654-wyrmling-wristlet)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This bracelet has 1d6 + 3 colorful, egg-shaped beads hanging from it. Ten types of beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the bracelet or determines it randomly. A bracelet can have more than one bead of the same type. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it into an unoccupied space that you can see up to 30 feet away from you. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead cracks open, destroying the bead, and summons a dragon wyrmling in the space. The type of wyrmling is determined by the bead’s color.

A summoned wyrmling disappears after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you summon another wyrmling. The wyrmling shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It is friendly to you and your companions until you threaten or harm it. The wyrmling obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.

When the last bead has been used, the wristlet becomes nonmagical.
