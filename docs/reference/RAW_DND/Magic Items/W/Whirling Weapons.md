# [Whirling Weapons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445635-whirling-weapons)

#Weapon *(any melee weapon without the special or two-handed property),* #Rare 

These magic weapons were forged with lightweight metals and designed for speed rather than brute force. _Whirling weapons_ have the [finesse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse) and [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Light)properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action and attack with a _whirling weapon_ that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you’re holding a different _whirling weapon_ in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.

In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.
