# [Wand of Merriment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445589-wand-of-merriment)

#Wand, #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This wand is made from a sprig of holly and exudes an unmistakable aura of cheer from it. It has 10 holly berries that each contain 1 charge and are used to fuel the wand’s properties. When you expend a charge from a berry, it wilts away and disappears. The wand regrows 1d6 + 4 missing berries daily at dawn. While you’re attuned to the wand, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma checks and saving throws.

**_Spells._** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16) from it: [[Create Food and Water]] (3 charges), [[Goodberry]] (1 charge), [[Tasha's Hideous Laughter]] (1 charge), or [[Otto's Irresistible Dance]] (6 charges).

**_Dashing through the Snow._** While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action. When you do, you ignore [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain) created by ice or snow. This movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

**_Festive._** As an action, you can wave this wand over up to 1 gallon of water and expend 1 charge to transform the liquid into a weak, but pleasant-tasting, alcoholic beverage.

If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, all but one of the wand’s leaves and berry stems wither away and die. When this happens, the wand becomes a common wand that does not require attunement, but has only 1 charge. This common version of the wand retains only the festive property of its original form and regains the expended charge daily at dawn.
