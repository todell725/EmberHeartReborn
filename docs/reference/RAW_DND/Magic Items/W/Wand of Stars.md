# [Wand of Stars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445592-wand-of-stars)

#Wand, #Rare  *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This antiquated, dark blue wand is adorned with a glowing star at its tip. When it’s swung, small specks of starlight drift from its end.

The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.

**_Spells._** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15) from it: [[Color Spray]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), [[Daylight]] (3 charges), [[Hypnotic Pattern]] (3 charges), [[Light]] (no charges), [[Magic Missile]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or [[Prestidigitation]] (no charges).

**_Starlight Wayfinder._** While you can see stars in the sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out a new direction.
