# [Wand of Puppetry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445591-wand-of-puppetry)

#Wand, #VeryRare *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand is made of wood and looks like the handle of a marionette. The wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of the creature’s limbs, including its head. For example, a humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The strings are [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition), but can be seen by a creature with a successful DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. Dealing 10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and disappear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free of and destroying any number of the strings connected to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature is more than 100 feet away from you.

While a creature has a string attached to one or more of its limbs, the following effects occur depending on the location of the strings:

**_Arm or Hand._** A creature with a string attached to one of its arms or hands must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw each time it attempts to use it, such as making a weapon attack, climbing a wall, or using an item. On a failed save, the action, attack, check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action requires multiple arms and only one of the creature’s arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, the creature doesn’t gain the benefits of holding it for the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, dropping any number of items it’s holding with the strung arms or hands on a failure.

**_Head._** A creature with a string attached to its head has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks, and Constitution saving throws made to maintain [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) on a spell when it takes damage. You can use an action to force the creature to speak on your turn, saying a word or phrase no longer than twenty-five words.

**_Leg._** A creature with a string attached to one or more of its legs (or similar limbs) has its speed reduced by 15 feet for each strung limb. If a flying creature’s speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it falls to the ground at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage when it lands. A creature with a string attached to each of its legs has disadvantage on Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and Dexterity saving throws.

**_Spell._** Alternatively, you can expend 5 charges to cast the [[Dominate Person]] spell (save DC 16) from the wand.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand becomes nonmagical.
