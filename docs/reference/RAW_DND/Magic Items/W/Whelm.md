_Whelm_ is a powerful weapon forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of [[White Plume Mountain]].

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**_Hurl._** _Whelm_ has the [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack roll using _Whelm_, the target takes an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 4d8 Force damage if the target is a Construct, an Elemental, or a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

**_Shock Wave._** You can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to strike the ground with _Whelm_ and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

**_Supernatural Awareness._** While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can cast [[Detect Evil and Good]] or [[Locate Object]] from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

**_Sentience._** _Whelm_ is a sentient, Lawful Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin.

**_Personality._** _Whelm_ has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. _Whelm_’s purpose is to protect dwarves. Conflict arises if the wielder doesn’t share this goal.

**_Destroying Whelm._** _Whelm_ can be dissolved in the acidic bile of a recently slain [ancient black dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194880-ancient-black-dragon). It can also be melted down in the forges of the Mightyhammer dwarf clan, but only by the rightful leader of that clan.
