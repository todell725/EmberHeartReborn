#Weapon *(any melee weapon),* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

These polished wooden weapons are traditionally used by the clerics and paladins of a righteous order to punish evildoers and aid the needy. Each of these magic weapons is blessed by a powerful priest or celestial. A _weapon of verdict_ has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn. You can use these charges to create the following effects:

**_Condemn._** When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target.

**_Commend._** As an action, you can expend 1 charge to touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to restore 1d8 + 2 hit points to that creature.
