# [Wand of Necrosis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445590-wand-of-necrosis)

#Wand, #VeryRare *(requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This gnarled, wooden branch has grown over one of the severed fingers of a powerful [lich](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195106-lich), creating a gruesome and deadly wand. The wand has 7 charges. If the wand has at least 1 charge remaining, you have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold it.

While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, attack bonus +7): [[Blight]] (4 charges), [[Finger of Death]] (7 charges), [[Inflict Wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, plus 1 additional charge to make its range 30 feet), or [[Ray of Enfeeblement]] (2 charges).

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand explodes, destroying the wand in a flash of green light that duplicates the effect of the [[Finger of Death]] spell, targeting only you. If you become a [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775851-zombie) as a result of this effect, you are under the command of the nearest lich within 100 miles of you, if any.
