#Weapon *(Mace),* #Rare *(Requires Attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack). For its action, it can use only the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
