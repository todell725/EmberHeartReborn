# [Mourningsteel Demi-Gauntlets](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445322-mourningsteel-demi-gauntlets)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This pair of dark, open-fingered gauntlets are made from mourningsteel, a metal whose ore has been steeped in the blood of countless fallen creatures. While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

The gauntlets have 12 charges and regain 1d6 + 6 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from them using a spell attack bonus of +8: [[Chill Touch]] (no charges, or 1 to cast at 5th level), [[Inflict Wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), or [[Vampiric Touch]] (3 charges). Damage dealt by these spells ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

In addition, if you spend a charge to cast [[Chill Touch]] from the gauntlets and hit a creature, you can immediately choose to expend additional charges to cast either the [[Inflict Wounds]] or [[Vampiric Touch]] spell from them as part of the action to cast the cantrip. When you do, the cantrip’s skeletal hand delivers the spell to the target, instead of requiring you to touch it. If you were already [concentrating](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) on the [[Vampiric Touch]] spell when you hit a creature with [[Chill Touch]] in this way (after spending a charge to cast it), you don’t need to expend any additional charges to deliver your [[Vampiric Touch]] spell to the target. Necrotic damage dealt by [[Chill Touch]] doesn’t count toward the amount dealt by [[Vampiric Touch]] for the purpose of calculating the number of hit points you regain from the spell.
