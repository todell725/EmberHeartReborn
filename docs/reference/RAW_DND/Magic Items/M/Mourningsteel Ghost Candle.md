# [Mourningsteel Ghost Candle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445323-mourningsteel-ghost-candle)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This candle holder and its candle never run out of wax while it burns, even if you aren’t attuned to it. Although wax runs down the sides of the candle, it never drips off it onto the holder, nor does it ever seem to be diminished or consumed. The candle can’t be removed from the holder. While the candle burns, ghostly hands reach out from the holder as if to warm their hands by the tiny fire.

If you’re holding the lit candle and its holder while attuned to it, [will-o’-wisps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195270-will-o-wisp)are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. In addition, you can use an action to cast the [[Blink]] spell from it. For the duration of the spell, whenever you vanish from your current plane of existence, a will-o’-wisp appears in your space there instead. The will-o’-wisp’s turn is immediately after your own, and it obeys your mental commands (no action required by you). The will-o’-wisp vanishes when you return from the Ethereal Plane or when it’s reduced to 0 hit points, at which point you return early to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.

Once the candle and holder have been used to cast this spell, it can’t do so again until the next dusk.
