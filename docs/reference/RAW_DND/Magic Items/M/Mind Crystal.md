#Wondrous *Item, Rarity Varies*

These gemstones contain a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic. Different types of _mind crystals_ exist, each with a different single-use effect.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding a _mind crystal_, you can modify the spell in a specific way that has an effect described below. You can use only a single _mind crystal_ to modify the spell, and you can’t use a _mind crystal_ and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use a _mind crystal_, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

_**[Careful](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247074-mind-crystal-careful) ( #Uncommon ).**_ Choose up to three creatures affected by the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.

_**[Distant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247075-mind-crystal-distant) ( #Uncommon ).**_ If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more and doesn’t have a range of self, the spell’s range increases by 100 feet. If the spell has a range of touch, its range becomes 30 feet.

_**[Empowered](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247076-mind-crystal-empowered) ( #Uncommon ).**_ When you roll damage for the spell, you can reroll up to three damage dice. You must use the new rolls.

_**[Extended](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247077-mind-crystal-extended) ( #Uncommon).**_ If the spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, double the spell’s duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

_**[Heightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247078-mind-crystal-heightened) ( #Rare).**_ Choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the spell.

_**[Quickened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247079-mind-crystal-quickened) ( #Rare).**_ You change the spell’s casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

_**[Subtle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7247080-mind-crystal-subtle) ( #Common).**_ You cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components for this casting.
