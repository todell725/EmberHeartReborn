#Weapon *(scimitar),* *rarity varies (requires attunement)*

The typical [magentan sun-saw](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445286-magentan-sun-saw-uncommon), an uncommon item, is a falchion with a curved metal guard that protects your hand. The sword has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

When you hit a target with this magic sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to reach your fingers around the weapon’s curved guard and pull it like a trigger. When you do, a line of whirring blades of light springs from the weapon’s edge and rips around the length of the sword, rending and tearing into the target to deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to it. The light is a vibrant magenta.

The following [magentan sun-saw](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445287-magentan-sun-saw-very-rare) is a very rare variant with more powerful properties. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you expend 1 of the weapon’s charges when you hit with an attack, the light is sunlight (albeit still magenta in color) and deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target, instead of 1d6. If the target has the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity trait, such as a drow or vampire, it’s considered to be in sunlight until the end of its next turn.
