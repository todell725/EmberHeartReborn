# [Matron’s Mug](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445300-matrons-mug)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare 

This rustic stoneware mug is warm to the touch and exudes a feeling of comfort while held. You can speak its command word as an action to cause it to fill with a rich, creamy drink that tastes like chocolate. When you drink this beverage, it fills you with a rejuvenating and magical vigor that builds over the course of 1 minute. At the end of this minute, you can choose to recover one expended spell slot by spending a number of Hit Dice equal to the spell slot’s level, up to a maximum of 5. Once the mug has created this beverage, it can’t create it again until the next dawn.
