# [Murk Blowgun](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445326-murk-blowgun)

#Weapon *(blowgun),* #Uncommon 

A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature takes an extra 1d4 poison damage. When you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) until the end of its next turn. It is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) while poisoned in this way.

In addition, this blowgun can be wielded as a magic club.
