# [Moonstone Bracers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445318-moonstone-bracers)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

These leather bracers are adorned with moonstones and unique wolfen buckles made of silver. While wearing these bracers, you have immunity to damage from the [[Moonbeam]] spell, and have resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from silvered weapons.

While wearing the bracers in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast [[Polymorph]] on yourself, transforming into a [wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775850-wolf). While you are in the form of the wolf, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The bracers can’t be used this way again until the next dusk.
