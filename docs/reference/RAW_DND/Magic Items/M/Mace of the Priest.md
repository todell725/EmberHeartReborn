# [Mace of the Priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445281-mace-of-the-priest)

#Weapon *(mace),* #Rare  *(requires attunement by a cleric)*

This magic mace is carried by priests and is a symbol of their devotion to ridding the world of evil. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to adjust its telescoping haft, changing it from a [mace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/11-mace) to a [quarterstaff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/12-quarterstaff), and vice versa. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast either [[Cure Wounds]] (3rd-level version) or [[Dispel Magic]] from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier.

Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the weapon’s command word to cast the [[Heal]] spell from it. When you do, the weapon releases a flash of light and is destroyed.
