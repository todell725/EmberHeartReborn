#Weapon *(mace),* #Uncommon 

This magic mace is actually an enchanted pumpkin whose stem is used as a handle. Its orange exterior is carved into a frightening visage with a toothy maw and unforgiving eyes. Between dusk and dawn, the pumpkin is lit from within with a magical flame that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the flame is lit, targets hit by the mace take an extra 1d4 fire damage, and when you roll a 20 on an attack roll with the flaming weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) of you until the start of your next turn.
