#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This soft cloak was once a child’s beloved blanket and has been miraculously enchanted by their hopes and dreams. While worn as a cloak, you can’t be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), and magic can’t put you to sleep. When unclasped, it can still be used as a warm blanket. When used as a blanket while sleeping or over the course of a short or long rest, you can’t be unwillingly targeted by the [[Dream]] spell, you gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) score, and you can’t be [surprised](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Surprise) as a result of being [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition). Regardless of how the cloak is used, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.
