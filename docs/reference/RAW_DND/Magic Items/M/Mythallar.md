# Mythallar

#Wondrous *item*, #Legendary *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A _mythallar_ looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, [[Netheril|Netherese]] mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the _mythallar_, the more magic it can hold. The largest _mythallars_ are 150 feet in diameter.

The _mythallar_ is a relatively small device — a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this _mythallar_, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the _mythallar_. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the _mythallar_ follows the attunement rules in the _Dungeon Master's Guide_. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the _mythallar_, nothing happens.

All creatures attuned to the  _mythallar_ can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The  _mythallar's_ properties are as follows:

- While you're on the same plane of existence as the  _mythallar_, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The _mythallar_ and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.
- As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the _mythallar_ to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the _mythallar_ again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.
- You can use the _mythallar_ to cast the [[Control Weather]] spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the _mythallar_ or the spell fails.

**_Touching the Mythallar_**. Any creature that touches the globe of the _mythallar_ must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) Radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the _mythallar's_ cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).
