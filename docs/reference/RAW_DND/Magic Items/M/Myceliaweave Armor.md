# [Myceliaweave Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445327-myceliaweave-armor)

#Armor *(leather, studded leather, or hide),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also gain a number of [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to half the number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic damage.

**_Curse._** Once you don and attune to this magic armor, you can’t doff it unless you die or are targeted by the [[Remove Curse]] spell: a side effect of the violet fungus’ magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until 2d6 + 6 days have passed or until you attune to the armor again.
