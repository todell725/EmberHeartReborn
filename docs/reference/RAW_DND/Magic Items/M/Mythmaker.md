# Mythmaker

#Weapon *(any object or body),* #Artifact *(Requires attunement)*

*Mythmaker* is a sentient legendary artifact that changes form to suit the wielder: a sword in the hands of a capable knight, a flute in the hands of a great bard, a pen in the hands of an exalted poet. Mythmaker is the downfall of one of the great evils of the world: the mad god [[Cyric]].

*Mythmaker* was created by [[Lliira]] to punish [[Cyric]] after he murdered [[Mystra]], causing the [[Spellplague]] in the year 33 DR. For the last 100 years, *Mythmaker* has served as the key to thwarting [[Cyric]]’s plans of returning to divinity. The artifact has taken the form of whatever tool would be most potent in preventing these plots from coming to fruition and has sought a wielder who could handle this responsibility.

**_Magic Weapon._** *Mythmaker* is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

When you attack a creature with the weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the weapon deals an extra 20 Radiant damage.

***Lorewrought.*** *Mythmaker* is among the most legendary weapons in all of the Forgotten Realms, and thus it has been present for many a legendary tale. Once per day, the wielder can cast [[Legend Lore]] through the weapon.

***Random Properties.*** The weapon has the following random properties (see “[Artifacts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#Artifacts)” in this chapter):

- 4 minor beneficial properties
- 1 major beneficial property

**_Sentience._** *Mythmaker* is a sentient Neutral Good weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to 120 feet.

The weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice mirrors the wielder's own inner monologue. While you are attuned to it, *Mythmaker* also understands every language you know.

**_Personality._** *Mythmaker* speaks with a voice that is joyful and playful, representing the aspect of [[Lliira]] lodged within.

The weapon's purpose is to continuously bring an end to the greatest evils of the world. It believes it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events. It is particularly keen on thwarting the schemes of the fallen god [[Cyric]].

*Mythmaker's* desire for cosmic justice is a powerful force. If the wielder spends 3 days or more not working towards the goal of destroying a great evil, a [conflict](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#Conflict) between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.

**_Destroying Mythmaker._** *Mythmaker* cannot be destroyed while [[Lliira]] retains her divinity. If the goddess were to lose her divine status, *Mythmaker* would become vulnerable, but would still remain extraordinarily difficult to destroy.
