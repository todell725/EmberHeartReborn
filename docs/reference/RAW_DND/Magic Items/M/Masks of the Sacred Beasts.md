# [Masks of the Sacred Beasts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445299-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts)

#Wondrous *item,* *rarity varies (requires attunement)*

These dark ceramic and gold masks are fashioned after animals that are sacred in certain cultures. Each mask’s appearance and properties are based on the sacred beast it represents. While attuned to a mask, you can end your attunement to it and attune to a different one over the course of 1 minute, instead of over the course of one or more short rests.

**_[Crocodile (Common)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445294-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts-crocodile)._** While wearing a crocodile mask, you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet and can hold your breath for up to 10 minutes at a time.

**_[Lion (Uncommon)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445297-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts-lion)._** While wearing a lion mask, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on smell. In addition, your nails extend into claws, turning your unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage with a damage die of 1d6.

**_[Hawk (Rare)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445295-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts-hawk)._** While wearing a hawk mask, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on sight, and attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. In addition, you can cast the [[Feather Fall]] spell at will, targeting only yourself.

**_[Mule (Very Rare)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445298-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts-mule)._** While wearing a mule mask, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws against being knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). In addition, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force that creature to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

**_[Jackal (Legendary)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445296-masks-of-the-sacred-beasts-jackal)._** While wearing a jackal mask, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and immunity to necrotic damage.

In addition, you can use an action to fire a beam of deathly green magic from your forehead at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the mask has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.

A humanoid killed by this necrotic damage rises at the start of your next turn as a [mummy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195135-mummy) under your control. The mummy acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, you can mentally command the mummy if it is within 120 feet of you and you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) (no action required). You decide what action the mummy takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

The mummy remains until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until it’s reduced to 0 hit points, or until you are no longer attuned to any _mask of the sacred beast_, causing it to turn to dust. You can only create and control one mummy at a time in this way.
