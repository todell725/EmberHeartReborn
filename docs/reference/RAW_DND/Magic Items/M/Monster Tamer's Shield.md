#Armor *(shield),* #Rare  *(requires attunement)*

This shield punishes certain creatures for their hostility and comes from a culture whose dominion is in direct competition with powerful beasts. While holding this shield, whenever you take damage from a melee attack made by a beast or monstrosity, that creature takes 1d4 psychic damage. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

**_Tamer’s Protection._** If you are also attuned to the [[Monster Tamer's Sword]] and are holding this shield, any creature captured by the sword gains a +1 bonus to its AC and can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition).
