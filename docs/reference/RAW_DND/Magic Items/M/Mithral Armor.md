#Armor *(Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),* #Uncommon

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.
