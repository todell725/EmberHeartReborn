# [Nightstalker’s Armor of the Northeastern Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445333-nightstalkers-armor-of-the-northeastern-wind)

#Armor *(plate),* #Rare  *(requires attunement)*

This unusual armor is composed of blue metal plates with a horned helm, and was tempered by the frigid breath of an [oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195150-oni).

**_Retributive Cold._** When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you while wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 cold damage to that creature.

**_Freezing Fog._** While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the [[Gaseous Form]] spell from it, targeting only yourself, with the following changes:

- You take the form of a frigid cloud of fog, creating illusory frost on objects you touch.
- You can take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action while in this form. When you do, your attacks are unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 cold damage, instead of their normal damage.
- You can use the armor’s Retributive Cold property.
- The spell has a duration of 1 minute.

Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.
