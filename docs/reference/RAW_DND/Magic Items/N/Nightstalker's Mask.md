# [Nightstalker’s Mask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445334-nightstalkers-mask)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This demon-faced mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 of its charges when you take the [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action to become [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) until the end of your next turn. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. If you make an attack against a creature while invisible in this way and hit, the target takes an extra 1d10 psychic damage.
