# [Covolt Dagger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445067-covolt-dagger)

#Weapon *(dagger),* #Uncommon 

This angular dagger is forged with covolt, an elemental blue metal that carries storm-like properties. When you score a critical hit against a target with an attack made with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.
