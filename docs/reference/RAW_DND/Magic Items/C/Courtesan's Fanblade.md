# [Courtesan’s Fanblade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445066-courtesans-fanblade)

#Weapon *(dagger),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This magic dagger is made of two hollow halves that can be opened with a flick of a small lever above its handle. Opening the dagger in this way reveals a beautiful paper fan that spreads out between the weapon’s two halves (no action required). While the fan is exposed, you can’t use this weapon to attack. You can close the fan and recombine the dagger’s halves again as a bonus action.

This dagger has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While the fan is exposed, you can use an action to cover your face with it and expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[Charm Person]] spell (save DC 13) at 1st level. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
