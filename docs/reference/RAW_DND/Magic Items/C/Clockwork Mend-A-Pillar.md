#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This segmented mechanical caterpillar is 5 inches long, weighs 1 pound, and is made of copper. It has several tiny copper legs that give it a 5-foot walking speed. Within it are multiple containers filled with silk filaments, spools of thread, dyes, and an incredibly strong adhesive. Each of these materials is expelled through a tube in its mouth, and it is equipped with a transmutation lens in its head that allows it to change the adhesive to various kinds of wood, metal, stone, or crystal.

As an action, you can speak the caterpillar’s command phrase to cause it to repair a broken or torn object or area that it’s set upon. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot across in more than 1 dimension, the caterpillar can create the material to repair it. The caterpillar then begins crawling over and repairing the object or area, taking 10 minutes for every cubic foot it repairs (minimum of 1 minute). The caterpillar can physically repair a magic item or construct, but can’t restore magic to such an object. After the caterpillar finishes repairing an object or area, it stops moving and makes a soft chirping sound audible out to 30 feet. Once the caterpillar repairs 10 cubic feet of material, it can’t be used again until 24 hours have passed.

The caterpillar is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage types. If the [[Mending]] spell is cast on the caterpillar while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the caterpillar drops to 0 hit points, it can’t be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.
