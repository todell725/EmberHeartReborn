#Weapon *(club),* #Uncommon 

This wooden club’s head has been naturally formed into the shape of a dragon’s maw. As an action, you can speak the club’s command word and strike the ground with it to cause a wave of thorns and thrashing vines to spring up from the ground in a 15-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage and be [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by the thorns and vines for up to 1 minute. A grappled creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity check, freeing itself on a success. At the end of each of its turns, a grappled creature takes 1d6 piercing damage as it’s constricted by the thorny vines. Once this property of the club has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
