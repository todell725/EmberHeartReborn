# [Charged Rapier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445044-charged-rapier)

#Weapon *(rapier),* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This blade snaps and crackles with electrical power as it’s waved through the air. While holding the rapier, you have resistance to lightning damage. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage to any target it hits.

**_Electric Charge._** If you are proficient with this weapon, when you move at least 20 feet in a straight line on your turn while holding this rapier, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to briefly disappear and transform into a bolt of lightning. When you do, choose an unoccupied space you can see within 20 feet of you that’s along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you’re moving. You form a 5-foot-wide line of lightning originating from yourself that extends to the unoccupied space. You reappear in that space as the bolt of lightning passes through anything in its path.

If there are any creatures in the line of lightning, roll a d20 and add 9 to the roll. If the total of the roll meets or exceeds the AC of any creature in the line, that creature takes 1d4 + 1 lightning damage as you pierce through it as the bolt of lightning.
