# [Chronal Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445048-chronal-sphere)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare 

This brass sphere is roughly fist-sized and weighs 1 pound. It vibrates gently while you hold it as tiny mechanisms whir inside. While holding the sphere, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing spectral clock hands to appear on its curved surface and indicate the current time. The hands remain on the surface of the sphere until you speak the command word again. This property only functions on the Material Plane.

**_Spells._** While holding the sphere, you can use an action to cast either the [[Haste]] or [[Slow]] spell (save DC 18, no [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required) from it. Once the sphere has been used to cast a spell in this way, it can’t be used to cast that spell again. When the sphere has been used to cast both of these spells, it loses this property.
