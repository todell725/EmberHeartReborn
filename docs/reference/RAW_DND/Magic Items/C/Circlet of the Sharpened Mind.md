# [Circlet of the Sharpened Mind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445050-circlet-of-the-sharpened-mind)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare  *(requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence score of 17 or higher)*

This iron circlet has a magical pearl at its center and can hold up to 4 gemstones. When found, the circlet has 2 gemstones. A gemstone worth at least 5,000 gp can be added to the circlet over the course of 1 minute as it’s magically drawn and fastened into place. While wearing the circlet, you can take a special [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn to summon a number of floating, spectral swords equal to the number of gemstones in the circlet and make one melee spell attack with each of them against a target within 10 feet of you. You are proficient with these attacks and use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for them. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. The swords appear at your side and remain there until you dismiss them as a bonus action or until you fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) or remove the circlet. While the swords are summoned, you can take this special Attack action once on each of your turns. The spectral swords shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

You can replace one of these melee spell attacks with a weapon attack as part of this special [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action. If you’re able to make multiple attacks when you take the Attack action, you can instead replace a number of these spell attacks up to the number of weapon attacks that you can normally make as part of the Attack action.

When a hostile creature’s movement provokes an [opportunity attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) from you, you can use your reaction to make one melee spell attack with one of the summoned swords against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.
