# [Cube of Summoning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228412-cube-of-summoning)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Rare

This Tiny cube looks like a jack-in-the-box. When you wind its crank as a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, a merry tune emits from the box, the lid pops open, a creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space, and the lid closes. The lid can’t otherwise be opened.

Roll on the Cube of Summoning table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 (save DC 17, +9 attack bonus) and doesn’t require [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), but you otherwise function as the spell’s caster.

Once the cube summons a creature, the cube can’t do so again until the next dawn.
