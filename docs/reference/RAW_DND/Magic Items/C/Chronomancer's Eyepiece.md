# [Chronomancer’s Eyepiece](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445049-chronomancers-eyepiece)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This singular lens lets you faintly see and command the flow of time around a target. The eyepiece has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the eyepiece, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction at the end of another creature’s turn to speak either of the eyepiece’s two command words to warp the flow of time around that creature. You must be able to see the target, and it must be within 60 feet of you.

**_Past._** If the target is willing, it is teleported back to the space it was at the beginning of its turn. If another creature or object is occupying the space, the target is teleported to nearest unoccupied space instead. An unwilling target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be teleported in this way against its will.

**_Future._** If the target is willing, it can immediately choose to move again, up to half its speed, without provoking [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack). After a target moves in this way, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
