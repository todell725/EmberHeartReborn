# Cloak of Derrick (Modern Variant)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare *(Requires Attunement)*

This cloak is pretty boring and not very "in" right now. However, attuning to this cloak does provide two benefits to the wearer. 

This cloak has 3 charges. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Dull Defender.** As a Reaction when you or an ally within 30 feet of you would be hit with an attack roll, you can spend *2 charges* to summon a spectral protector named [[Derrick, the Unrelenting|Derrick]]. Derrick appears in front of the target and attacks for the rest of the round target him instead. He has an AC 14 and 20 HP.

**Dreary Disguise.** As an Action, you can spend *1 charge* and cast a limited version of [[Alter Self]]. The disguise is always [[Derrick, the Unrelenting|Derrick]]. Any Deception or Persuasion checks made pertaining to being absolutely, devastatingly unremarkable are made with Advantage while in this disguise.
