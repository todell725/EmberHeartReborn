# [Club of the Rook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445059-club-of-the-rook)

#Weapon *(club),* #Uncommon 

This club is a magic weapon and has a weighty stone tower at its end. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to move up to 30 feet in a line to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground, barreling through creatures no more than one size larger than you and objects that weigh no more than 400 pounds in the line. This movement doesn’t provoke [opportunity attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) and ignores [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain). Each target in the line you barrel through must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition). On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. If a target in the line is a structure or is too large or heavy to barrel through, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw and your movement ends early. Your movement also ends early if you attempt to move over a space in which you normally can’t, such as over a gorge or up a wall.

The club’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the club can still be used as a magic weapon.
