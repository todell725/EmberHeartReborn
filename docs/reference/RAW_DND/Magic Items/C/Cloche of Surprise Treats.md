#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare 

This magic silver cloche covers a large dinner platter. You can use an action to speak the cloche’s command word and remove it from the platter. When you do, use the table below to determine what kind of meal appears.

| d12    | Meal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**      | A delicious meal appears on the platter large enough for one creature and provides as much nourishment as 1 day of rations.                                                                                                                                            |
| **2 – 5**  | A number of decadent, perfectly ripe mixed berries equal to twice the number rolled on the d12 appear on the platter. Eating one of these berries duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the [[Goodberry]] spell. These berries remain potent for up to 10 days. |
| **6 – 12** | The cloche magically conjures a great feast, as if by the [[Heroes' Feast]] spell. This version of the spell can feed a number of creatures equal to the number rolled on the d12.                                                                                     |

Once the cloche has been used to conjure a meal in this way, it can’t be used again until a number of days have passed equal to the number rolled on the d12.
