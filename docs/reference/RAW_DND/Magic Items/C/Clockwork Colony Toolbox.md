# [Clockwork Colony Toolbox](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445054-clockwork-colony-toolbox)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This trim bronze toolbox rattles softly with the sound of bolts, screws, and other tools inside. The box weighs 3 pounds and is 3 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot deep. Inside the toolbox are four empty, resizable bins with nothing inside. Any metal object left inside the closed toolbox for 1 hour becomes meticulously clean and polished.

Similarly, any small machine (such as a compass or hunting trap) left inside the closed toolbox for 1 hour is magically repaired. Any magical item with “clockwork” in its name regains all its hit points when left in the toolbox in this way. If the magical item has charges or additional magical properties, it regains 1d4 expended charges and the ability to use those properties again. Once an item or object has been restored in this way, it can’t be restored by the toolbox again for 24 hours.
