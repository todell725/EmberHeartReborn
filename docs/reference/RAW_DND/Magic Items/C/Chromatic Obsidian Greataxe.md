# [Chromatic Obsidian Greataxe](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445047-chromatic-obsidian-greataxe)

#Weapon *(greataxe),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This prismatic greataxe is made using chromatic obsidian, a dazzling type of stone found where several Elemental Planes meet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A target takes 1d6 cold damage, 1d6 fire damage, 1d6 lightning damage, and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll the damage dice separately, recording any 6 you roll. For each 6 you roll in this way, use the table below to determine which of the following effects apply.

| Damage Type | Effect                                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold**        | The target’s speed is halved until the end of your next turn.                                |
| **Fire**        | The target takes an extra 6 fire damage at the end of its next turn.                         |
| **Lightning**   | The target can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.                             |
| **Radiant**     | The next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage. |
