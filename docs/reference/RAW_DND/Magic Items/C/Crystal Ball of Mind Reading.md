While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[Scrying]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast [[Detect Thoughts]] (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this _Detect Thoughts_ spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the _Scrying_ spell ends.
