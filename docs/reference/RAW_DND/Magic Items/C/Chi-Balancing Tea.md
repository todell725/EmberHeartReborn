# [Chi-Balancing Tea](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445045-chi-balancing-tea)

#Potion, #Rare 

This potion is specially brewed by the monks of Durheim using a unique leaf found only in their gardens. The tea remains magically warm while inside its traditional porcelain bottle. The potion’s flavor is deep and smoky, and leaves a sour aftertaste like the air after a storm.

When you drink this potion, it cures any short-term madness afflicting you, and if you are [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), it ends those conditions. In addition, if you have 2 or more levels in the monk class, you regain 1d4 + 1 expended ki points.
