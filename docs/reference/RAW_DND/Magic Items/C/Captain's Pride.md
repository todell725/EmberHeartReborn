# [Captain’s Pride](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445037-captains-pride)

#Armor *(leather or studded leather),* #Rare *(requires attunement)*

This well-crafted leather armor comes with a sturdy, enveloping longcoat, bearing on its back the insignia of a well-known pirate captain. When you attune to it, the insignia changes to one that represents you instead. While wearing this armor, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra movement, and you can breathe underwater.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to shift into a watery, elemental form, gaining the following benefits for the duration:

- Your speed increases by 10 feet.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, as well as resistance to acid damage.
- You have advantage on ability checks to avoid or escape being [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) or [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). If you’re already grappled or restrained when you shift into this form, you automatically escape.
- While you’re underwater, Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks made to see you have disadvantage.

This form lasts as long as you [concentrate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
