#Weapon *(longsword, scimitar, or shortsword),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement by a creature of neutral alignment)*

This magic weapon comes from a clan of sentient [wurms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/175314-wurm) that debilitate their foes with strange magic. This sword has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with the sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to force that creature to make a DC 13 saving throw of your choice. On a failed save, a creature is subjected to an effect based on the kind of saving throw it made:

- **Strength.** The creature gains a –2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **Dexterity.** The creature’s movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
- **Constitution.** If the creature is Large or smaller, it loses its balance and is pushed 15 feet away from you.
- **Intelligence.** The creature has disadvantage on the next spell attack it makes within 1 minute.
- **Wisdom.** The creature becomes slightly sluggish and can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.
- **Charisma.** The creature has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you until the end of its next turn.

**_Wiggling Charges._** While you’re attuned to this weapon as well as the [[Jo'Catian Rebuker]], you can use charges from either item to fuel this weapon’s properties.
