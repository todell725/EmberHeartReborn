#Armor *(shield),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement by a creature of neutral alignment)*

This magic shield is forged by a mysterious group of sentient [wurms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/175314-wurm) whose work is prized for its craftiness. This shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take damage from a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and are holding the shield, you can expend 1 of its charges as a reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d6. When you do, you can also choose an ability. Until the end of its next turn, that creature magically has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes of the chosen ability.

Once a creature has been affected by this property, it can’t be affected by it again for 1 minute.

**_Wiggling Charges._** While you’re attuned to this shield as well as the [[Jo'Catian Denier]], you can use charges from either item to fuel this shield’s properties.
