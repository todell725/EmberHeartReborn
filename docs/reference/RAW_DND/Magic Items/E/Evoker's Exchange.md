While wearing this amulet, you can choose to convert the damage from one form of raw energy to another. You can use this amulet as a spellcasting focus when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals only fire or lightning damage and doesn’t require [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration). When you do, you can choose to have the spell deal lightning damage if it originally dealt fire, or fire damage if it originally dealt lightning.

If a spell that deals fire damage would normally ignite flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried, it does not if it’s converted to lightning damage in this way. However, a spell that deals lightning damage does ignite such objects if it’s converted to deal fire damage instead.
