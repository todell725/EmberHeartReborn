# [Enzymatic Gastrostaff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445116-enzymatic-gastrostaff)

#Staff, #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This staff was found in the regurgitated remains of a mighty [tarrasque’s](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195232-tarrasque) meal and is covered in a strange, magical mucus. You have resistance to acid damage while you hold this staff. The staff can be used as a magic quarterstaff and deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to any target it hits.

In addition, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller willing creature with the staff to cast the [[Enlarge Reduce]] spell from it without requiring [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration), targeting the creature with the spell’s Enlarge option. While a creature is enlarged in this way, it deals double damage to objects and structures and gains 1d6 + 4 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints) at the start of each of its turns, in addition to the spell’s normal effects. The effect ends early if the enlarged creature falls to 0 hit points. When the effect ends, the creature gains 1 level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition). Once this property of the staff has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
