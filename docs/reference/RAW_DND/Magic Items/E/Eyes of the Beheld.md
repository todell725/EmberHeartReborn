#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

These button-sized metal trinkets typically come in sets of two and resemble the fearsome visage of a one-eyed monster. As an action, you can place one firmly on a solid surface—such as a wall, table, or boot—where it remains until destroyed. While you’re within 5 feet of one, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word to cause its eye to open. The opening is about the size of a keyhole, and by peering through it, you can open and see through another eye’s opening of your choice. You choose which eye to look through the first time you peer into the hole and can change it again using a bonus action.

The eyes you can choose to see through in this way must be a part of the set, be placed on a solid surface, and be on the same plane of existence as the one you’re looking through. You can only see through one eye at a time, which operates both ways, and nothing can pass through the hole. If another eye attempts to look through one you’re already using, the connection between the first two ends and is replaced by the new one. An eye closes when it’s no longer being looked through.

Each eye has AC 10 and 5 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, the eye is destroyed. If a target or area is immune to divination magic or can’t be perceived through scrying sensors, it doesn’t appear through the hole. If you find another eye of the beheld, you can connect it to an existing set by holding it against another eye from the set for 1 minute.
