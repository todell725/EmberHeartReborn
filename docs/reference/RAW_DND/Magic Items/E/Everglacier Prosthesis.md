# [Everglacier Prosthesis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445123-everglacier-prosthesis)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare *(requires attunement by a creature missing a hand, arm, or leg)*

When found, this item appears to be a roughly hewn length of ice with runes etched into its side. To attune to this item, you must attach it to the end of your missing arm or leg, at which point the ice magically attaches to you and forms an icy copy of the appendage it’s replacing. The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body and can’t be removed against your will as long as you’re attuned to it.

While the prosthetic is attached, you have resistance to cold damage, and your unarmed strikes with the limb deal cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

In addition, the prosthesis has 6 icy spikes protruding from its surface. You can use an action while the prosthetic is attached to launch up to 3 of the spikes at one or more targets within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each spike, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. 1d4 + 2 launched spikes regrow daily at dawn.
