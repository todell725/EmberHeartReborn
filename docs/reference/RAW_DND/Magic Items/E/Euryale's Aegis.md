# Euryale's Aegis

#Armor *(Shield),* #Legendary *(Requires Attunement)*

This gleaming brass shield bears a relief of the legendary medusa druid [[Euryale]]

While wielding this shield, you gain the following benefits:

***Blessing of Euryale.*** You have resistance to poison damage and are immune to the [petrified](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#petrified_phb)condition.
    
***Petrifying Heraldry.*** As a bonus action, you can make the front of the shield flare with a medusa's petrifying magic, causing the relief's eyes to glow brightly. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or it has the [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) condition as its body turns to stone. The [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) creature must make another DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the start of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature has the [petrified](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#petrified_phb) condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the [restrained](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#restrained_phb) condition ends. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
    
***Spellcasting.*** While wielding the shield, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[Lesser Restoration]], [[Locate Creature]], [[Transport via Plants]]. Once you use the shield to cast a spell, the shield can't cast that spell again until the next dawn.
