#Staff, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)_

Bound into this staff is a spell of level 8 or lower. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/12-quarterstaff).
