# Eye of Vecna

#Wondroustem, #Artifact *(Requires Attunement)*
## Campaign Lore
Back in the possession of [[Vecna]] after the events of [[MM Recaps|MM]]. 
## Magic Item
[[Vecna]] was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, [[Vecna]] feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.

A treacherous lieutenant named [[Kas the Bloody-Handed]] brought [[Vecna]]’s rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of [[Vecna]], all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work [[Vecna]]’s will in the world.

The _Eye of Vecna_ and the [[Hand of Vecna|Hand of Vecna]] are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.

**_Random Properties of the Eye and Hand._** The *Eye of Vecna* and the [[Hand of Vecna|Hand of Vecna]] each have the following random properties (see “[Artifacts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#Artifacts)” in this chapter):

- 1 minor beneficial property
- 1 major beneficial property
- 1 minor detrimental property

**_Attuning to the Eye._** To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die.

**_Properties of the Eye._** While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

**Truesight.** You have [Truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight) out to 240 feet.

**Spellcasting.** The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that [[Vecna]] tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM’s control.
## Eye of Vecna Spells
| Spell                | Charge Cost |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| [[Clairvoyance]]     | 2           |
| [[Crown of Madness]] | 1           |
| [[Disintegrate]]     | 4           |
| [[Dominate Monster]] | 5           |
| [[Eyebite]]          | 4           |

**X-ray Vision.** You can take a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

**_Destroying the Eye and Hand._** If the *Eye of Vecna* and the [[Hand of Vecna|Hand of Vecna]] are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the [[Sword of Kas]], both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of [[Vecna]]’s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.
