# [Eyedrops of Clarity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445125-eyedrops-of-clarity)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This eyedropper is stoppered with a cork at the opening of its spherical top, which is designed in the likeness of an eye. When found, the eyedropper contains 1d4 + 2 doses of magical solution. When uncorked, the solution inside begins to drip from the eyedropper. A creature can use its action to uncork and apply 1 dose of the eyedrops to itself or another willing creature that it can see within reach, stoppering the eyedropper again once finished. A [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) creature that has eyes and receives a dose of the eyedrops ceases to be blinded. In addition, that creature gains [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to a range of 30 feet and has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks that rely on sight for 1 hour. If the creature already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet for the duration.
