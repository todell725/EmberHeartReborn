# [Elder Sequoia Scale Mail](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445113-elder-sequoia-scale-mail)

#Armor *(scale mail),* #Rare *(requires attunement by a druid)*

This hardy, natural mail is made with leather and protected with the large outer shell of an elder sequoia seed cone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a mighty evergreen tree. The tree is 5 feet across at its base and can be up to 40 feet tall. Its branches extend up to 10 feet away from its trunk and must be at least 5 feet above its base.

The tree has hit points equal to 5 times your druid level, AC 20, and vulnerability to fire damage. While you’re a tree, you magically retain your normal senses and gain [tremorsense](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Tremorsense) out to a range of 30 feet, but your speed becomes 0, and you can only use your actions to shuffle your limbs (as if by a breeze or rustling creature), revert to your normal form, or use your Wild Shape again.
