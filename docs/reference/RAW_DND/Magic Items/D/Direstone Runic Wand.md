# [Direstone Runic Wand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445085-direstone-runic-wand)

#Wand, #Rare *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):

**_Algiz._** You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

**_Eihwaz._** You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[Arcane Lock]] spell. When you use this spell to lock a second object, the spell ends on the first one.

**_Hagalaz._** You can expend 2 charges to cast the [[Shatter]] spell.

**_Kenaz._** You can expend 1 charge to cast the [[Burning Hands]] spell, or 2 charges to cast the [[Heat Metal]] spell.

**_Raidho._** You can expend 4 charges to cast the [[Stone Shape]] spell. This version of the spell can alter the form of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).

Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the [[Illusory Script]] spell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or metal surfaces.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are not a dwarf when this happens, you must also succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition) until freed by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or similar magic.
