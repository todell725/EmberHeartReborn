# [Dust of Dryness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228523-dust-of-dryness)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Uncommon

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. As a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot [Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a [Water Elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195261-water-elemental) or a [Water Weird](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195262-water-weird)). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
