#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

This tough leather hat and cowl help protect you against the extreme heat and sun of the desert. While wearing the cowl, you can withstand temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and if you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait while wearing the hat.

In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to speak its command word and throw it on the ground within 10 feet of you. The hat becomes a [giant scorpion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195026-giant-scorpion) under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the hat to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the scorpion.

On your turn, you can mentally command the scorpion if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). You decide what action the scorpion takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

The hat remains in scorpion form for up to 8 hours. If the scorpion is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its hat form. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
