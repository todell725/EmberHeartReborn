# [Direstone Dwarven Key](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445084-direstone-dwarven-key)

#Weapon *(handaxe),* #Uncommon *(requires attunement by a dwarf)*

This dwarven handaxe is specially issued to guards of the Direstone mines, treasury, and prisons. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If it hits a stone object, the hit is automatically a critical hit.

In addition, you can use an action to speak the handaxe’s command word and strike a fixed stone surface with it, such as a wall or ceiling. If the surface is no more than 2 feet thick, it magically pulls apart to form a temporary doorway. The doorway is no more than 5 feet across in any dimension and closes at the end of your next turn, leaving no trace of it behind. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it. When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the doorway created by the handaxe are ejected to an unoccupied space on a random side of the stone surface and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 12 hours have passed.
