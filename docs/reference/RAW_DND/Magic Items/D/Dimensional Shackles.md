# [Dimensional Shackles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9228465-dimensional-shackles)

#Wondrous *Item*, #Rare

You can take a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action to place these shackles on a creature that has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
