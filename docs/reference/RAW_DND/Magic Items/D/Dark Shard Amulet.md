#Wondrous *Item*, #Common *(Requires Attunement by a Warlock)*

This amulet is fashioned from a shard of resilient material originating from an otherworldly realm. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use the amulet as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

**_Unknown Spell._** As a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don’t know. The cantrip must be on the Warlock spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast it is wasted. In either case, you can’t use this property again until you finish a Long Rest.
