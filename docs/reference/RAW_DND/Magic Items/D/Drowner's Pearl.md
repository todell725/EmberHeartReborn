# [Drowner’s Pearl](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445101-drowners-pearl)

#Wondrous *item,* #Common 

This magic, sickly pearl contains a fragment of life absorbed from a body that sank to the bottom of the sea. While holding this pearl in your mouth, you can survive for 1 additional minute before you suffocate when you run out of breath or begin to choke underwater. Once this property has been used, the pearl turns to dust and is destroyed.

_Clink, clonk, clink,  
A man is in the drink.  
Can he swim  
‘Gainst the tidal whim  
That’d keep him far from shore?_

_Clink, clonk, clink,  
The man’s begun to sink.  
But why’s he there?  
None seem to care,  
With nary an “O’erboard!”_

_Clink, clonk, clink,  
No one stops to blink.  
For when the earl  
Wants drowner’s pearls,  
You simply must make more.
