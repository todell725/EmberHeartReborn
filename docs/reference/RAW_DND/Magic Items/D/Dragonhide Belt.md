This finely detailed belt is made of dragonhide. While wearing it, you gain a bonus to the saving throw DCs of your Focus features. The bonus is determined by the belt’s rarity. In addition, you can use an action to regain Focus points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die. You can’t use this action again until the next dawn.
