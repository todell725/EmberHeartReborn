# Deck of Wild Cards

#Wondrous *item*, #Rare

This deck of heavy vellum cards hums with the magic of the [[Elemental Chaos]].

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (a deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck). As an action, you can draw a random card from this deck and throw it to make a ranged spell attack, using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 30 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 slashing damage and imposes a magical effect determined by its suit, as detailed in the _Deck of Wild Cards_ table. The card immediately returns to the deck after it hits or misses a target.
