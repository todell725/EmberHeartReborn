# [Dragon Horn Pauldron](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445093-dragon-horn-pauldron)

#Wondrous *item,* #VeryRare *(requires attunement)*

This single pauldron is made from the horn of a fallen dragon. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to one damage type, which is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the horn, as shown on the table below.

| Dragon | Resistance |
| ------ | ---------- |
| **Black**  | Acid       |
| **Blue**   | Lightning  |
| **Brass**  | Fire       |
| **Bronze** | Lightning  |
| **Copper** | Acid       |
| **Gold**   | Fire       |
| **Green**  | Poison     |
| **Red**    | Fire       |
| **Silver** | Cold       |
| **White**  | Cold       |

In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage of this resisted type, you can use your reaction to instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.
