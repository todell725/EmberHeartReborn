#Potion, #Common or #Rare 

The typical [djinn and tonic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445087-djinn-and-tonic-common), a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes a magical wind to tussle your hair, cloak, or other clothing dramatically for 1 hour after you drink it. A small mote of mist dances above the potion’s liquid and gently stirs it. The beverage is smooth, bubbly, and very refreshing with notes of juniper, elderberries, white peach, and lavender. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

The following [djinn and tonic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445088-djinn-and-tonic-rare) is a rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Gaseous Form]] spell for 10 minutes (no [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) required) or until you end it early using an action. When the effect ends, your form rematerializes in a rush of air, forcing all Large and smaller creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).
