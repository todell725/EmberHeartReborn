# [Death’s Shadow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445082-deaths-shadow)

#Wondrous *item,* #Legendary *(requires attunement)*

This black garnet amulet is carved into the shape of a bird’s skull and is adorned with several dark feathers. At its center is a single phoenix feather that serves as a catalyst for this strange talisman’s necromantic magic. While wearing this amulet, you are immune to necrotic damage.

**_Shadow Form._** When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing this amulet, a shadowy version of yourself rises from your [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) body. You control this form, which has your equipment and statistics. It has 100 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) and resistance to all damage that isn’t force, psychic, or radiant. The shadow form can’t move more than 60 feet from your body. The shadow vanishes after 1 minute or when it loses all its temporary hit points. If the shadow survives for the duration, it returns to your body and causes you to regain a number of hit points equal to the shadow’s remaining number of temporary hit points. If the shadow is defeated, the amulet is destroyed and you immediately fail 2 death saving throws.

While your shadow form is defending you, your [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) body is covered by an impenetrable veil of shadow. While covered in this way, you can’t be interacted with: you are immune to all damage, don’t make death saving throws, can’t regain hit points, and can’t be affected by spells or magical effects. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the covered body up to 10 feet on a success.

Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.
