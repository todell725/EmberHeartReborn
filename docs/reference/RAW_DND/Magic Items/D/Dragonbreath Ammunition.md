# [Dragonbreath Ammunition](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445096-dragonbreath-ammunition)

#Weapon *(arrow or bolt),* #Rare 

This metallic ammunition flies effortlessly on its own when fired. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action and make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire this ammunition at a point you can see within range. The arrow or bolt explodes when it reaches the point, destroying the ammunition and creating either a cone or 5-foot-wide line of dragon’s breath in the direction it was fired. The created effect depends on the metal it was cast from. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 damage of the associated type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Use the table below to determine the effect’s area of effect and damage type:

| Ammunition Metal | Area         | Damage Type |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Brass**            | 60-foot line | Fire        |
| **Bronze**           | 90-foot line | Lightning   |
| **Copper**           | 60-foot line | Acid        |
| **Gold**             | 60-foot cone | Fire        |
| **Silver**           | 60-foot cone | Cold        |
