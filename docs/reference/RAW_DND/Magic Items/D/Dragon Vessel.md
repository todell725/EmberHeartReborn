# Dragon Vessel

#Wondrous *Item, Rarity Varies (Requires attunement)*

This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

**Slumbering ( #Uncommon).** As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): Ale, Olive Oil, a [[Potion of Healing]], or a [[Potion of Climbing]]. Once this property is used, it can’t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn’t imbibed within 24 hours.

**Stirring ( #Rare).** In addition to the options for a Slumbering vessel, you can fill a Stirring vessel with Mead, a [[Potion of Fire Breath]], or a Greater [[Potion of Healing]].

**Wakened ( #VeryRare ).** In addition to the options for a Slumbering or Stirring vessel, you can fill a Wakened vessel with Wine, a [[Potion of Flying]], or a Superior [[Potion of Healing]].

**Ascendant ( #Legendary).** In addition to the options for other states, you can fill an Ascendant vessel with Whiskey, a Supreme [[Potion of Healing]], or a [[Potion of Dragon's Majesty]].
