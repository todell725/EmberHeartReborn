#Armor *(plate),* #Legendary *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this shimmering armor, you gain a supernatural buffer to your vitality and resilience. The first time you don and attune to this armor, and whenever you finish a long rest while attuned to it, you gain 50 [temporary hit points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints). You lose these temporary hit points if you remove the armor. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and if you have temporary hit points, you also have resistance to nonmagical damage.
