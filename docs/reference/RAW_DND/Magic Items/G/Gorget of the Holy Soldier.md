# [Gorget of the Holy Soldier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445175-gorget-of-the-holy-soldier)

#Wondrous *item,* #Legendary *(requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*

This magical gorget is imbued with the divine power of a **planetar** and has been passed down through multiple generations, manifesting a different power for each wearer. While wearing the gorget, you have resistance to radiant damage and gain the following benefits. If you have a feature that allows you to ignore class, race, or level requirements when you use a magic item, you can choose to gain the benefits of one of these properties. You make this choice the first time you attune to the item.

**_Investiture of the Planetar._** If you have 10 or more levels in the barbarian class, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 26, and while you’re raging, any creature you hit with a melee weapon attack takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.

**_Litany of Heaven._** If you have 10 or more levels in the bard class, you gain the ability to speak and understand all languages. In addition, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

**_Divine Judge & Jury._** If you have 10 or more levels in the cleric class, you always have the [[Commune]], [[Dispel Evil and Good]], and [[Raise Dead]] spells prepared, and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, when you cast _raise dead_ using a spell slot, you can choose to cast it as an action, instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the spell requires no material components and returns the target to life with half its maximum hit points. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

**_Herald of Omens._** If you have 10 or more levels in the druid class, the gorget becomes covered in vines and leaves. While wearing it, you always have the [[Control Weather]] and [[Insect Plague]] spells prepared, and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a pair of white-feathered wings from your back. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings last until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

**_Unstoppable Legionnaire._** If you have 10 or more levels in the fighter class, you can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

**_Angelic Grace._** If you have 10 or more levels in the monk class, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you have advantage on ability checks to resist being [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition). In addition, while you aren’t wearing any armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.

**_Caress of Life._** If you have 10 or more levels in the paladin class, your Lay on Hands pool of healing power increases by 10 hit points. In addition, you can expend 10 hit points from your pool of healing to end the effects of blindness, deafness, or paralysis on a creature. Alternatively, you can expend 15 hit points from the pool to end a curse affecting a creature or object, as if by the [[Remove Curse]] spell.

**_Sight of the Celestial Warden._** If you have 10 or more levels in the ranger class, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks and gain [truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight) out to 15 feet. In addition, you can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty and are able to discern fine details as though looking at something from no more than 100 feet away.

**_Heavenly Messenger._** If you have 10 or more levels in the rogue class, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[Invisibility]] spell (no [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration)required) from the gorget, targeting only yourself. Once the spell has been cast, it can’t be cast again until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

**_Luminous Soul._** If you have 10 or more levels in the sorcerer class, you learn the [[Light]] and [[Dancing Lights]] cantrips as well as the [[Guiding Bolt]] spell, which don’t count against your number of cantrips or sorcerer spells known. You can cast [[Guiding Bolt]] by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points and hit a target, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change its damage type to radiant.

**_Pact of Veracious Awareness._** If you have 10 or more levels in the warlock class, you know if you hear a lie. If you hear a creature tell a lie, you can attempt to force that creature to tell the truth. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be compelled to answer the next question you ask it truthfully. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**_Celestial Wards._** If you have 10 or more levels in the wizard class, your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice). In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
