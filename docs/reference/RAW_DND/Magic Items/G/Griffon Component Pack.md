# [Griffon Component Pack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445183-griffon-component-pack)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon 

This special component pouch is stylized in the fashion of the legendary [[Griffon's Saddlebag]], a classic motif in children’s fiction. As an action, you can place an amount of coins equal to 5 gp plus the exact worth of a component you need for a spell you know in the bag and speak its command word, followed by the name of the needed component. When you do, the coins disappear from the bag and are replaced by the material component needed for the spell. Once this property of the bag has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

At the GM’s discretion, the bag may consume only the additional 5gp and leave a note that describes the nearest person or place that can help you find the named component.
