If you’re hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
