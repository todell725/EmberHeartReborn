# [Gloves of Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445166-gloves-of-healing)

#Wondrous *item,* #Rare 

These silken gloves enhance the rejuvenating power of healers and clerics. While wearing the gloves, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to one or more creatures, you can choose one target of the spell to regain additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Alternatively, a creature can regain these additional hit points if you use a [healer’s kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/515-healers-kit) to stabilize or restore hit points to it. Once a creature regains extra hit points in this way, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.
