#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon  *(requires attunement)*

This draping shoulder cloak flutters softly while worn, even if there isn’t a breeze. The cloak has 10 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action while wearing this garment, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special ranged spell attack using the cloak, expending 1 of its charges for each attack you replace. When you do, you flourish the cloak and release a barrage of magical feathers that fly toward the target. You have a +5 bonus to attack rolls made with the cloak, which have a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 + 3 force damage. After the attack, the feathers vanish.

In addition, you can use a reaction when you fall to cast the [[Feather Fall]] spell from the cloak, targeting only yourself. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
