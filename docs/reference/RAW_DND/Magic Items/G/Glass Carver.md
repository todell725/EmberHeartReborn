# [Glass Carver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445164-glass-carver)

#Weapon *(dagger),* #Uncommon 

This magic dagger’s edge is lined with a sharp, enchanted crystal that magically pierces through glass. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to cut a straight line up to 1 foot long into a piece of nonmagical glass no more than 1 inch thick. Each line emits a faint glow, allowing you to see any lines you’ve made. Making these lines requires you to focus, as if concentrating on a spell. Your [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) ends early if you are no longer holding the dagger or aren’t within reach of the glass. When your concentration ends, any line you made with the dagger magically vanishes and repairs itself.

You can connect these lines to form a cutout shape in the glass. As part of the action to complete this shape, make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The DC for this check is equal to 8 plus half the number of actions it took to form the shape. On a success, you silently remove the cutout glass shape. On a failure, the cutout glass shatters. Once the shape is removed in this way, either in one piece or as shattered glass, your [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting#Concentration) ends without repairing the glass.

If the original glass shape is returned to the hole, you can spend 1 minute retracing the cuts made to the glass with the dagger to seamlessly repair the damage done to it, as if by the [[Mending]] spell.
