# [Gloves of the Great Badger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445168-gloves-of-the-great-badger)

#Wondrous *item,* #Uncommon *(requires attunement)*

This pair of fingerless gloves is decorated with badger-like stripes and fitted with razor-sharp claws. While wearing the gloves, your unarmed strikes with them deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you gain a burrowing speed of 5 feet.

While wearing the gloves, you can use a bonus action to invoke the might of a giant badger, granting the following benefits for 1 minute:

- Your burrowing speed is doubled, and you can burrow through nonmagical, unworked stone.
- You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls whenever you make an unarmed strike with the gloves.
- Your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
