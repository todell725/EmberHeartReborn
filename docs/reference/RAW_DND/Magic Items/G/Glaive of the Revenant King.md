#Weapon *(glaive),* #Legendary  *(requires attunement)*

This long-lost silver glaive once belonged to an elven king. Its impeccable elven make lets it be swung nimbly, despite its size. This weapon has the [finesse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Finesse) property. In addition, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**_Sentience._** The glaive is a sentient weapon of chaotic good alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Elvish and Sylvan.

**_Personality._** The glaive is inhabited by the spirit of Kelren, the elven king of Imfe Mythse. His life’s mission to rid his kingdom of demons, fiends, and other unwelcome ilk lives on inside the weapon. He seeks to rebalance the flow and seasons of nature, eager to destroy anything that threatens to change the natural ecosystems of the world.

Kelren is stern, but honest. He may share stories of his kingdom from time to time if an anecdote serves to further his ambitions. A character who he deems unworthy of wielding the blade, such as a weak or evil creature, may be denied the ability to attune to the weapon.

**_Elven Kinship._** You are considered proficient with this weapon if you are an elf or half-elf. In addition, while attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with fey creatures.

**_Energy Nullification._** If you hit a target with this weapon that is either resistant or immune to cold or fire damage, that target loses that resistance or immunity until the end of your next turn.
