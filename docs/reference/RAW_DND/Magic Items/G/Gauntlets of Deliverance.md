These silver gauntlets are inscribed with powerful sigils that absorb malady and infection. When you magically cure a creature of [blindness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [deafness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), disease, or [poison](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) while wearing these gauntlets, you can choose to have the sigils on the gauntlets contain the condition instead of destroying it outright. While the gauntlets contain a condition in this way, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature and force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the effects of the stored condition until the end of your next turn, as the condition is passed from the gauntlets into it. Whether the creature succeeds or fails the saving throw, the stored condition is then lost from the gauntlets.

The gauntlets can only hold one condition at a time. Any contained condition is lost if you contain another one in order to make room for the new condition.
