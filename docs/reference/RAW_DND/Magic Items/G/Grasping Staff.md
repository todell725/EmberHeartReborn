# [Grasping Staff](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445176-grasping-staff)

#Staff, #VeryRare  *(requires attunement by a warlock or wizard)*

This grotesquely carved stone staff is miraculously light but deathly cold and clammy to the touch. You have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [[Bigby's Hand]] (5 charges), [[Bestow Curse]] ( 3 charges), [[Chill Touch]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), [[Inflict Wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), [[Mage Hand]] (no charges), or [[Vampiric Touch]] (3 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to ash and summons 2d6 hostile tiny undead [crawling hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194954-crawling-claw) within 10 feet of you.
