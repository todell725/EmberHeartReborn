# [Viper Khopesh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9445584-viper-khopesh)

#Weapon *(scimitar),* #Rare 

This curved blade was carved from a large viper’s fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) until the start of your next turn. The poisoned creature is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn’t poisoned.
