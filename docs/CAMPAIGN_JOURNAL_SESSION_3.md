**STORY SO FAR**:
After a morning of agricultural triumph, King Kaelrath received guidance from the Star-Forge AI. The Spires were building a Relay Tower to broadcast a 'Mind-Anchor' over Emberheart. Refusing to let his people be forgotten, the King led a lethal surgical strike to the North Rim. The objective is clear: kill the High Inquisitor, destroy his golems, and use the Star-Forge 'Leap' flare to seize control of the ley-lines.
