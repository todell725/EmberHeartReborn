**STORY SO FAR**:
The "Capture & Reclaim" initiative has resulted in the single greatest shift in world power in the history of the Ridge. Following a perfect lab calibration (20), King Kaelrath executed a flawless boarding action (NAT 20). As the *Accordance* dropped from its levitation height, the King and the "Iron Eleven" jumped across the void. The sheer intimidation of the Smith-King, backed by his golden-eyed automatons, forced Captain Aurelius to surrender the flagship without a scuttle. Emberheart now possesses a Tier-1 Dreadnought and three support frigates. The blockade is over; the reign has begun.
