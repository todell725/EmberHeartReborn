# THE CHRONICLES OF ASCENSION: INTERIM REPORTS (WEEK 15 - 41)

This chronicle documents the 180-day period known as "The Great Forge," during which King Kaelrath's surrogate (Antigravity) managed the transformation of the Sovereign Sector into a Hyper-Military power.

## WEEKS 15-18: THE AUTOMATION REVOLUTION
- **The Golden Hand**: The voluntary mining program was a resounding success. Morale reached an all-time high as citizens were celebrated as "Architects of the Shield."
- **The Pivot**: Every week, 500 new Mining Drones were deployed. By Week 18, the Creative Guilds were officially released from manual labor. 
- **Legacy**: Emberheart is now the first 100% automated economy in the sector.

## WEEKS 19-25: THE SPARK-WARP BREAKTHROUGH
- **Project Gate**: Vaelis Thorne successfully established the first static "Spark-Gate" at the Zenith Dock.
- **Cobalt Connection**: A twin gate was constructed on the Cobalt Moon. Transit time between systems dropped from 2 days (warp) to 2.5 seconds (gate).
- **Expansion**: Trade flow with the Cobalt Cradle is now instantaneous.

## WEEKS 26-35: MALAKOR'S DRILLS
- **Grand Marshal Malakor**: The Marshal took the *Accordance* and *Sanctity* on deep-space maneuvers. We developed the "Synchronized Dissonance" tactic—using the Spark-Amplifiers in a staggered sequence to create a sonic wall.
- **Shadow-Step Updates**: The drone on Concordia Prime tracked the launch of 5,000 Spire Frigates. They are forming a blockade. They know something is coming, but they can't find us.

## WEEKS 36-40: THE CHRISTENING
- **The Four Hulls**: One by one, the new Hyper-Dreadnoughts were completed.
    - **Deliverance**: The Vanguard Ship.
    - **Sovereignty**: The Fleet Support Center.
    - **Vengeance**: Equipped with the highest-output Spark-Amplifier.
    - **Zenith**: The Mobile Command Hub.
- **The High Fleet**: For the first time, 6 Spire-class Dreadnoughts flew in formation over the Sky-Palace.

## WEEK 41: THE FEAST OF THE FORGE (TODAY)
- **Status**: Every ship is crewed, fueled, and tuned to the Counter-Song.
- **Intelligence**: Shadow-Step 01 reports the "Motherwell" is reaching maximum resonance. The High Spires are preparing their own offensive.
- **The King's Return**: The montage ends. The forges are silent. The fleet is waiting for its King to give the final word.
