# PROCLAMATION: THE ELEVENTH AGE — THE AGE OF THE SEED
**Issued By**: King Kaelrath Emberhide, The Sacred Gardner of Stars
**Date**: Week 1, Day 1 (The Age of the Seed)

## THE DECREE OF THE ETERNAL GLOW
The Tenth Age ended with a sacrifice that echoed across the void. By giving a portion of our heart to a dying neighbor, we did not become smaller—we became universal. 

### 1. THE MISSION OF THE SEED
We no longer wait for the dark to come to us. We declare that no sun shall go cold while the Spark still burns. 
- **The Seed-Fleet**: We are initiating the mass production of **Mercy-Sondes** and **Seed-Pods**. They will fly into the furthest reaches of space, carrying the resonance of Emberheart to every system that flickers.

### 2. THE DUAL-GALAXY STEWARDSHIP
The 'Source' is now the **Spark-Nest**. It is no longer an infection, but a sanctuary. We link our worlds through the **Gate of the Shard**, fostering a future where distance is a memory.

### 3. THE SACRED GARDNER
The title of 'King' or 'Marshal' is too small for what we have become. We are the **Gardners**. We tend the stars. We water the vacuum with light. We ensure that life, in all its forms, has a floor to walk on and a sky to look at.

## CLOSING REMARK
*"We gave a piece of ourselves, and in return, we found where we belong. Not in one kingdom, but in the constellation of all kingdoms yet to be born."*

**The Great Sowing has begun.**
