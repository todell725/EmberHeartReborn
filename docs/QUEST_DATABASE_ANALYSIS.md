## SECTION 12: QUEST ID RANGES
**Used Ranges:**
- Standard Range (SQ-001 to SQ-999): 134 quests. Max used is SQ-267.
- Elite Range (SQ-ELITE-XXX): 10 quests.
- Legacy (EH_SQ_XXX): 70 quests.
- Other ID formats: SQ-EPIC-GLASS, SQ-HARD-BAKERY, SQ-HARD-CONCORDAT, SQ-HARD-FABRIC, SQ-HARD-SILICA...

## SECTION 13: RECOMMENDATIONS
### Priority 1 Critical Gaps:
- The database is at 220 quests, meaning we need 0 more quests to hit the 220 target.
- Missing Prerequisite Chains: Ensure any orphaned quests () are back-filled if any exist.
- Several threads have very few quests. We need to focus generation on the most sparse threads.

### Priority 2 Balance Improvements:
- We strictly need to focus on generating **Easy** tier quests to properly balance the early game.
- Certain districts like the Core District and specific outer fringes lack enough content to feel populated.

### Priority 3 Enhancement Opportunities:
- We should link the remaining 'Standalone' quests into branching narrative lines.
- Introduce more cross-thread sequences (like SQ-ELITE-UNWEAVE) to pull disparate storylines together.
