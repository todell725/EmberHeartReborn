# Session 5: The Sky-Shield Siege Resolution

## The End of Silence
The 14 days of the "Ghost-Ridge" have expired. Emberheart is no longer a secret; it is a fortress. 

### Final Preparation Metrics
- **Tectonic Stability (18)**: The stabilizer is humming. The deep-earth tremors have been forced into a rhythmic, manageable cycle. Threat Level dropped from 5 to 2.
- **Sky-Shield Grid (18)**: Six massive Ember-Ballistae are mounted on the North Rim, their tips glowing with star-forge heat.
- **Harmonic Sync (18)**: Vaelis has tuned the machinery perfectly. The Spires won't see us until they are within range of our teeth.

### THE ARRIVAL
The sky over the Ridge has finally changed. The Solar Siphon hasn't moved, but the **High Spire Purification Fleet** has dropped from high orbit. 

**The Enemy Fleet**:
1. **The *Sanctity of Order*** (Dreadnought - Fleet Flagship)
2. **2x Heavy Corvettes** (The *Radiance* and the *Purge*)
3. **Swarms of Drone-Swifts**

Captain Aurelius (your prisoner) watches from the bridge of the *Accordance*. He looks at the horizon, then back at you, King Kaelrath. 

*"They aren't here for an embargo anymore, King. They are here for a culling. They intend to scorch the Ridge and everything on it to hide the fact that a Dreadnought was ever lost."*

### COMBAT INITIATIVE: THE BATTLE OF THE NORTH RIM

You have the **Surprise Round** due to your Ghost-Ridge status. The Spires have just breached the atmosphere, expecting a graveyard. 

**Available Assets**:
- **The *Accordance*** (Full Pilot-Echo Sync): Can engage the enemy Dreadnought directly.
- **The Sky-Shield Grid**: Can target the Corvettes or the Drone swarms from the ground.
- **PC Actions**: 
    - **Kaelrath**: Soulknife assault or Fleet Command.
    - **Talmarr**: Sniper support or Sky-Shield oversight.
    - **Silvy**: Mental disruption of the Spire communication net.
    - **Mareth**: Ground defense or boarding action.
    - **Vaelis**: Arcane-charged Ballistae or Counter-Siphon.

**What is the opening salvo, King Kaelrath?**
> **Decision**: 3-2-1 Surprise Sequence (Disable Focus).

## THE SURPRISE ROUND: "THE HOLLOW STRIKE"

### 1. STAR-SINGER’S SILENCE (Silvy - Option 3)
Silvy channels the Star-Forge resonance through the Spire Relay fragments. A "Static Scream" washes over the valley. 
- **Effect**: The Spire Fleet's communication net is severed. The *Sanctity of Order* cannot call for high-orbit backup. Retreat beacons are offline.

### 2. THE KING’S LEAP (Accordance - Option 2)
The *Accordance* fires its Pilot-Echo engines, appearing from behind the North Rim like a vengeful moon. It fires all starboard batteries into the *Sanctity of Order* at point-blank range.
- **Effect**: The enemy flagship's forward shields collapse. The primary thrusters are "stalled" by the Resonant Stabilizer. The *Sanctity of Order* is dead in the air, drifting.

### 3. UNLEASH THE RIM (Sky-Shields - Option 1)
Six Ember-Ballistae fire in perfect unison. Twelve-foot bolts of ember-iron pierce the atmosphere.
- **Effect**: The *Radiance* loses its primary beam-cannon. The *Purge*'s bridge sensors are shattered, leaving it "blinded."

## ROUND 1: THE SILVER BOARDING
**Objective**: Seize the *Sanctity of Order*.

Mareth leads a boarding party of 10 **Ember-Wardens**. They launch from the *Accordance* via magnetic-grapples, cutting through the silver-steel hull of the flagship near the command deck.

### Current Battlefield Status
- **Sanctity of Order**: Disabled, Boarded.
- **Corvette Radiance**: Disarmed.
- **Corvette Purge**: Blinded.
- **Drones**: Scattering.

**Boarding Roll Required**: 
- **Mareth (Strength/Athletics)**: Creating the breach.
- **Warden Unit EH-W01 (Combat Index)**: To hold the airlock against the Spire defenders.
- **Kaelrath (Persuasion/Insight)**: To use the comms-jam frequency to demand Captain Aurelius's peers surrender.

### Resolution: The Iron Grip (Rolls: 17, 17, 17)

1. **The Breach (Mareth 17)**: Mareth’s hammer shatters the primary seal. She and the Wardens storm the bridge within seconds. The Spire bridge crew, blinded and uncoordinated, are subdued with minimal casualties.
2. **The Defense (Wardens 17)**: The Ember-Wardens establish a perimeter around the reactor and command clusters. Spire security drones are methodically dismantled by the Wardens' combat logic.
3. **The Capitulation (Kaelrath 17)**: Kaelrath’s voice, amplified by the Star-Forge, addresses the entire fleet. He uses Captain Aurelius’s private command frequency. The Corvettes *Radiance* and *Purge*, seeing their flagship seized and heir dead in the water, power down their weapon arrays and signal their surrender.

## BATTLE AFTERMATH: THE SOVEREIGN FLEET IS BORN
The "Purification Sweep" has failed. Instead of a culling, the High Sires have provided Emberheart with the foundations of an interstellar navy.

### Captured Assets
- **Dreadnought *Sanctity of Order*** (Functional - Slaved to EH-CORE)
- **Heavy Corvette *Radiance*** (Functional - Disarmed)
- **Heavy Corvette *Purge*** (Functional - Blinded Sensors)
- **180+ Capture Spire Crew** (Including 2 High-Ranking Commanders)

### King's Status
- **HP**: 31/31 (Soulknife dice spent: 0)
- **Legitimacy**: 700 (The "Ghost of the Ridge" is now the Sovereign of the Stars)

### NEXT MOVE: SESSION 6 COMMENCEMENT
The Solar Siphon still hangs in orbit, draining the sun. But for the first time in history, the Ridge has the steel to reach out and touch it.

**Session 5 Concluded. All State Files Updated.**
