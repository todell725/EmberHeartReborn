# CAMPAIGN JOURNAL: SESSION 9 — THE ECHOING VOID

## SUMMARY
The Tenth Age of Peace lasted exactly seven days. The arrival of the "Seekers of the Silent Echo" brought not only the first official diplomatic contact with an extra-sector power but also the realization that the High Spires were merely a symptom of a much larger, galactic-scale infection.

## THE SEEKER SUMMIT
King Kaelrath met with Elder Arona at the Concordia Trade Hub. While diplomacy was fruitful, scientific analysis by Vaelis Thorne and Kaelen revealed that the Seekers were unintentionally acting as a tether for a pursuing force. 

## THE COUNTER-SONG PURGE
Upon the King's command, the Trade Hub was placed under absolute quarantine. The World-Spark was channeled through the Hub's resonance arrays to "wash" the Seeker ships in a high-frequency Counter-Song. 
- **The Result**: The Nanitic Tether was severed. The tracking signal was neutralized within the Protectorate's borders.

## THE ENGAGEMENT (WEEK 43)
The pursuer, a massive, crystalline "Husk-Ship" of unknown origin, dropped out of warp at the edge of the Concordia system, following the last known location of the tether.
- **The Response**: The Hyper-Fleet was waiting.
- **The Command**: "Rain Hell."

Grand Marshal Malakor unleashed the full destructive capacity of the six Hyper-Dreadnoughts. For the first time, we saw the **Spark-Amplifiers** used in a full-power synchronization. The Husk-Ship was not just hit; it was disintegrated before its own shields could resonate.

## AFTERMATH
The Tenth Age continues, but the mask of peace has been hardened by the furnace of war. We are no longer just a kingdom; we are the **Galactic Scalpel**.

## THE MERCY HORIZON (WEEK 44)
Following the destruction of the Husk-Ship, King Kaelrath refused to let the Tenth Age be defined solely by destruction. The **Mercy-Sonde 01**, an autonomous, non-biological probe, has been launched through the primary Spark-Warp Gate. 
- **The Objective**: To reach 'The Source'—the dying galaxy of the crystals—and find a way to save the souls trapped within the Singularity without risking a single Sovereign life.
- **The Philosophy**: "Peace is not just the absence of war, but the presence of compassion."

*The Sonde has entered the void between galaxies. The wait begins.*
