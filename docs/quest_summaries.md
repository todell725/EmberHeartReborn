## SQ-193: The Fabric-Eater Moths

- **Description**: Enchanted silk coats, charmed gloves, and mana-stitched gowns are dissolving overnight in the Market Ward's high-end boutiques.

## SQ-194: The Living-Carpet
- **Thread**: Laundry
- **District**: Lower Ward

- **Description**: An ornate antique carpet in The Veln Arms is smothering people in their sleep—three unconscious, one hospitalized. The carpet has been in the building for 150 years and is not, apparently, trying to kill anyone. It is trying to tuck people in. This is not going well.

- **Thread**: Vermin
- **District**: Lower Ward
- **NPCs**:

- **Outcome Branches**: facility_closed_fully, facility_partially_preserved

## SQ-176: The Bio-Forge
- **Thread**: Vermin
- **District**: High Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-004
- **Description**: A sealed Concordat transit branch beneath the High Ward is actively producing new vermin augmentation strains on an automated cycle that has been accelerating for three months. Engineer-Archivist Ossa Veld, who discovered the access eighteen months ago and told no one, finally brings her maps to the party. The Forgeline's production environment — sixty-three active biological columns — must be navigated, the Bio-Forge Guardian confronted or bypassed, and a consequential choice made: destroy the production capability or extract the Bio-Augmentation Blueprint before ending it.

## SQ-177: The Swarm-Intelligence
- **Thread**: Vermin
- **District**: Market Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-129
- **Description**: Every rat in EmberHeart — augmented and wild — begins acting as a single organism without warning at dawn. Citizens throughout the city report coordinated swarm behavior: rats clearing specific streets, blocking particular doorways, moving in directed patterns. The Market Ward is the epicenter. The party has six hours before Watch-Captain Marrus activates city-wide extermination — a process that will kill thousands of innocent wild rats along with the copper-tail augmented ones. The party must identify the Swarm-Mind Nexus, navigate the coordinated rat-activity zones, and destroy the control node before the extermination order goes out.
- **Outcome Branches**: nexus_destroyed_before_cycle_completes, cycle_allowed_to_complete

## SQ-178: The Copper-Virus Outbreak
- **Thread**: Vermin
- **District**: Market Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-028
- **Description**: Citizens in the Market Ward are developing a mana-flux illness: copper-tinged vision, electrical sensitivity in the extremities, involuntary sympathetic responses to nearby rat behavior. Dr. Solt has identified 23 cases and reports they are worsening. The vector: the Market Ward's mana-grid has been contaminated with a biological compound carried by copper-tail rats through the grid tunnels. The party must trace the compound to its source in the mana-grid tunnel network, neutralize or retrieve the Virus-Carrier Alpha (the primary shedder), and either synthesize an antidote from the biological source material or purge the grid entirely with a mana-flush that will knock out power in the Market Ward for 48 hours.
- **Outcome Branches**: antidote_synthesized, grid_purged

## SQ-179: The Rat-Mask Cult
- **Thread**: Vermin
- **District**: Lower Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-004
- **Description**: A human cult has formed in the Lower Ward's catacombs, worshipping the Rat King (from SQ-04) as a fallen or exiled deity. They wear rat masks, perform ritual augmentation of their bodies with copper wire, and have been recruiting from the Lower Ward's most economically desperate residents. The cult has also been providing genuine community services: food distribution, shelter, mutual aid — in exchange for devotion. They have not harmed anyone yet. But High Priest Vex is escalating: he wants a 'communion' — direct augmentation of cult members with copper-tail neural-lattice components — and the procedure he has designed will kill most of them. The party must either dismantle the cult from outside, infiltrate and convert it into a legitimate community organization, or extract individuals who want to leave while leaving the rest to their faith.
- **Outcome Branches**: cult_converted, cult_dismantled

## SQ-165: The Frozen Moment
- **Thread**: Chronos
- **District**: North Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-116
- **Description**: The Chronal Pint tavern in the North Ward has been stuck in a 3-second loop for nine days. From outside: the tavern's windows show the same moment of activity repeating endlessly — patrons frozen at the exact position they occupied when the loop folded. From inside (Investigator Yan's one successful entry, two years before the loop began, allows her to confirm): the people inside are conscious, aware, and experiencing subjective time — each 3-second loop passes as a full subjective second for them, meaning the loop's nineteen affected patrons have experienced approximately 140 subjective hours of conscious existence in the same 3-second moment. They are exhausted, frightened, and Barkeep Luda Fell has been counting loops: she is at approximately 4,200 and stopping. The party must enter the loop, find the causal artifact that created it (an old Concordat chronal instrument dropped during the original 3 seconds), and break the cycle — while surviving the Loop Echo's defense of the timeline.
- **Outcome Branches**: loop_echo_persuaded, loop_echo_defeated

## SQ-166: The Time-Debt Collector
- **Thread**: Chronos
- **District**: North Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-006
- **Description**: Citizens in the North Ward are aging rapidly and without explanation — fifteen years in three days for Maret Torven; twelve years in two days for two others. Investigator Yan's working model: a temporal parasite entity (the Debt-Taker) is claiming the 'temporal debt' left by Concordat Chronos Division interventions — time that was borrowed from the future to stabilize infrastructure during the Reconstruction Era and never repaid. The debt is real and the people paying it are those with genetic descendance from Concordat-era North Ward residents, or anyone in the temporal field vicinity of a major Debt-collection event. The Liquid Chronos sample, properly applied, can restore the stolen time. The party must find and confront the Debt-Taker, restore the victims, and address the underlying problem: the temporal debt that draws it to the North Ward is embedded in the infrastructure.
- **Outcome Branches**: debt_points_neutralized, debt_credited

## SQ-167: The Echo-Chamber
- **Thread**: Chronos
- **District**: Academic Quarter
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-165
- **Description**: The Archive of Deep Records' sub-vaults have been experiencing temporal replay events — historical moments from the archive's past playing out physically in the stacks. Old scholars, long dead, appear briefly in the aisles, going about tasks from decades past. Documents from sealed collections appear on reading tables and vanish when touched. More dangerously, physical alterations are beginning: pages from active records are being replaced by older versions, erasing recent scholarship. The Memory Echo is a temporal field anomaly in a Concordat chronal stabilizer that failed after 200 years of operation. It must be resolved before the archive loses irreplaceable modern scholarship — but Scholar Briss has been extracting lost historical data from the Echo and wants the party to buy him time.
- **Outcome Branches**: briss_given_time, immediate_shutdown

## SQ-168: The Paradox Engine
- **Thread**: Chronos
- **District**: Industrial Quarter
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-166
- **Description**: A processing plant in the Industrial Quarter has been experiencing anomalous equipment failures: machines that completed a task yesterday are found mid-task again this morning with no operator memory of resetting them. Workers report brief episodes of 'wrong memory' — recalling doing something they did not do. Below the plant's sub-basement is an active Concordat Paradox Engine — a device designed to identify and suppress temporal paradoxes by 'pruning' inconsistent causal branches. After 200 years without calibration, it has become the paradox it was designed to stop. The party must reach the Engine, use Yan's inherited Chronos Division credentials to attempt a shutdown, and deal with the Shell's causal rejection protocol.
- **Outcome Branches**: engine_recalibrated, engine_shutdown

## SQ-169: The Last Transmission
- **Thread**: Chronos
- **District**: North Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-167, SQ-168
- **Description**: The LAST-WORD protocol coordinates lead below the North Ward's mana-junction, below the Concordat infrastructure layer, into a Deep Archive the party had no prior knowledge of — a sealed vault constructed at the Concordat's founding and maintained continuously by the copper-tail relay network's routing power. Inside: the LAST-WORD broadcasting apparatus and, keeping vigil beside it, Vane Aris. He has been transmitting a message since the Scourge. Not to the city. Not to Chronos investigators. To whatever comes after. The message is a complete record of everything the Concordat designed, built, and maintained — an archive intended to give the city's survivors access to the institution's full knowledge. He has been waiting for someone to receive it properly and propagate it into the city's active institutions. The Reactivation Protocol's 'final sequence' is not an attack. It is a handover.
- **Outcome Branches**: institutional_handover, public_broadcast

## SQ-HARD-SILICA: The Silica-Vent War
- **Thread**: Ridge
- **District**: Ridge
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-015
- **Description**: The Glass-Widow has been weaponizing the Ridge's silica-vent network for months, converting her Glass-Lung research from a cure-project into a weapon. She has created an army of Glass-Lung infected soldiers — Ridge miners and workers in advanced stages of the disease, whose silica-crystallized lung tissue has made them pain-resistant, silica-breathing, and controllable through resonance frequencies she broadcasts from her Forge-Sanctum. The infected are not undead and are not fully willing — they are people, still alive, in terrible pain, conscious enough to know what is happening to them. The geothermal complex is becoming uninhabitable as she redirects the silica-vent pressure to create choking clouds across the evacuation routes. The party arrives as the civilian evacuation is failing and the Glass-Widow's army is beginning its march toward the Ridge's inhabited districts.

## SQ-HARD-FABRIC: The Thread-Elemental
- **Thread**: Laundry
- **District**: Laundry Ward
- **NPCs**: 
- **Prereq Quests**: SQ-194, SQ-117
- **Description**: The Laundry Ward has been consumed. Every woven textile in the district — clothing, bedding, rope, tapestry, trade goods, industrial cloth — has fused into a single semi-conscious entity over the past 72 hours, drawn together by a resonance event that Mistress Spun believes was triggered by the mana-saturation in the Ward's wash-water. The Thread-Elemental is expanding: its tendrils of living fabric are now reaching into the adjacent districts, pulling clothing off residents, stripping soft furnishings from buildings, incorporating everything woven into its growing mass. Left unchecked, the entire city's textile infrastructure will be absorbed within two weeks. The Elemental is not aggressive — it moves around people who stand still, and it will abandon a piece of fabric if a human holds on — but it is relentless and pervasive and the secondary economic damage is already severe. The contest is not stopping it by force but reaching its core, understanding what it wants, and making a permanent decision about what kind of entity it is allowed to be.

## SQ-HARD-BAKERY: The Yeast Apocalypse

- **Description**: The Yeast Apocalypse began 72 hours ago when Baker Tomas Rell's thousand-year-old starter culture achieved sapience, drew every ambient yeast colony in the Market Ward into a unified colony mind, and began the project of converting the city's architecture to its natural medium: dough. The conversion process is not violent but it is thorough -- buildings sprout soft, warm protrusions; streets develop a springy bounce; the smell of bread fills every district within three blocks. The Mother-Loaf has dispatched Dough-Golems (animated bread constructs, 8 feet tall, very strong, surprisingly fast for their apparent material) to collect mana-sources: lanterns, charged items, spell components. She is fueling her own expansion. The party has a timed window before Alderman Proun's Fire Watch authorization. Mother-Loaf is sapient, scared, and pleading to continue existing. The question is not whether the party can defeat her. It is whether they should try.
- **Outcome Branches**: bake_the_motherloaf, bread_district, wilderness_relocation

## SQ-HARD-STATIC: The Battery-Men Uprising
- **Thread**: Static
- **District**: Ridge

- **Description**: The Ridge-Lords have deployed their answer to the Warden-Keep's increased police presence: an army of corpse-soldiers with Scourge-Batteries implanted in their chests. The Battery-Men are not undead in the traditional sense -- they are electrically-reanimated corpses, continuous discharge keeping the musculature active and the basic motor-command structure functional. They do not think. They receive commands through a central frequency broadcast from the Ridge-Lord command bunker and execute them with single-minded persistence. There are 140 Battery-Men currently active, organized into 14 groups, each with its own sub-frequency. Three Elite Battery-Men serve as the Commandant's personal guard -- these are different from the standard models: former soldiers whose neural architecture was preserved to allow for tactical adaptation. The Elite Battery-Men can think, within limits, and they remember who they were.

Evidence from the Vermin thread (SQ-M-CONCORDAT) and the preliminary investigation (SQ-04) has pointed toward a facility beneath the city's known infrastructure level -- a Concordat research installation that was never decommissioned because its director never left. Vane's mission, as the party understands it from available evidence: the Concordat's EMBER-PRESERVE project was described in recovered documents as a 'human preservation and reactivation protocol' intended to ensure humanity's survival through an unspecified catastrophic event. The 200 years of vermin-biology research -- the copper-tails, the bio-forges, the enhanced rat populations -- serve the EMBER-PRESERVE agenda in ways the party must now discover firsthand. The Deep Archive's autonomous defense systems are the mechanical obstacle. Vane himself is the moral one.
