**THE DRAGON-FORGE PULSE (NAT 20)**:
Kaelrath tuned the Siphon and Shard to a flawless pitch. When the steam vented, it didn't just push—it *purged*. The resulting harmonic wave shattered every High Spire anchor within five miles. The 'Glass-Rot' was neutralized instantly. Silvy's voice, amplified by the pulse, reached every ridge-camp as a call for a new age. The High Spires have been forced into a chaotic retreat. Emberheart is no longer a victim; it is a Beacon.
