## LOG ENTRY 01: THE DISCOVERY
> "Patrol Beta found it drifting in the asteroid belt. A purple geode, pulsing with a faint light. It’s beautiful. The science team says it emits a low-frequency hum. We brought it aboard for the collection."

## LOG ENTRY 04: THE HARMONY
> "The hum is getting louder. It’s not just noise; it’s... math. The engineers report that the station's hull plates are vibrating in unison. Morale is up. Everyone is humming the tune. I feel... focused."

## LOG ENTRY 09: THE TRANSFORMATION
> "Structural failure in Sector 4. The steel isn't breaking; it's changing. It's turning into crystal. The Medical Officer says the crew's vital signs are synchronizing. We are all beating with one heart. Why was I afraid?"

## VAELIS THORNE ANALYSIS
**Subject**: The Singing Geode
**Theory**: "Bio-Crystalline Sonic Terraforming."

**Counter-Measure**: "We need a Dissonance. The World-Spark is a chaotic, living energy. If we can amplify the Spark's 'Roar', it might shatter the Geode's 'Song'."
