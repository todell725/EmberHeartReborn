**STORY SO FAR**:
The Siege of the Ridge is over, but the War for the Stars has begun. After a legendary "Capture & Reclaim" boarding action, King Kaelrath sits on the bridge of a Tier-1 Dreadnought. The Western Trade Basin is scrambling to align with the new power, while the High Spires have retreated to their high-orbit satellite arrays. The threat is no longer annexation by land, but an embargo from the heavens.
