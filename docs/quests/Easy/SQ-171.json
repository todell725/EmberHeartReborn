He is a precise, wildly anxious man, and his scarred hands aggressively shake as he traces the reported 'shadow-holes' tightly with a thick grease pencil. 'Fourteen confirmed visual tears in the Lower Ward,' he mutters rapidly, 'each appearing over the past six weeks, each one growing slightly larger than the last.' Near each localized optical tear, he notes tiny, disturbingly deep footprints in the mud\u2014too heavy for rats, the completely wrong shape for mice. 'I properly mapped them,' he says, his voice breaking. 'Look. Look at the precise shape.' The marks form a massive, frighteningly perfect geometric polygon spanning three city blocks. He cannot yet tell what polygon it is, but it is undeniably engineered.",
