Her 'oracle' is Pip, a brown rat whose eyes pulse with a faint, surgical blue light and whose squeaks follow a precise, unnatural rhythm perfectly synchronized with local market shifts. The predictability indicates the rat is receiving external data via a concealed Concordat neural implant. The party must uncover the source of Pip's transmissions, dealing with Iris's protective thugs and the entity feeding the rat economic intelligence for its own ends.",

At the table's center, a small brown rat sits perfectly still inside a rusted, gilded cage, emitting sharp, rhythmic squeaks that Iris dramatically 'translates' for the crowd. 'Pip says the grain price will spike in four days!' she announces grandiosely. As silver coins hit her table, you notice Pip's eyes glowing with a faint, surgical blue pulse. His squeaks are not random animal noises; they are a perfectly timed sequence, recurring at the exact same interval, mimicking a mechanical clock rather than a living creature.",

You instantly spot a tiny, metallic node buried deeply behind its left ear, pulsing with a faint blue light that synchronize perfectly with its rhythmic vocalizations. Whatever Pip is 'predicting,' he is mechanically receiving the data.",

They are not customers\u2014their eyes track Pip, not Iris. Their cloaks bear a subtle mark: a stylized rat skull stamped in copper on their inner lapels. The Concordat has watchers here. They are waiting for something.",
