He currently looks absolutely terrified. 'Exactly sixty of them,' he aggressively whispers, motioning with a shaking lantern toward the heavy iron sewer junction. You can perfectly hear a strange, incredibly faint noise echoing off the wet stone\u2014not squeaking, but something significantly lower, much more rhythmic. A deeply unified, sickening hum, like a single, perfectly sustained mechanical note held by dozens of tiny, wet voices. 'They have been sitting perfectly still there all night. The massive dead one lying in the exact middle, I genuinely do not know if it was there first or if they purposefully brought it. And they utterly refuse to move. I violently kicked a heavy iron bucket directly near them. They just... turned in perfect unison and looked at me. Then they turned perfectly back.' He pauses, wiping pure sweat from his forehead.

They are not grieving in any human sense. They are transmitting. The dead Copper-Tail's body is the subject of the transmission.
