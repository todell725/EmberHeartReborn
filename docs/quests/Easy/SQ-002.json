    "description": "Grain Silo 4 in the Lower Ward's agricultural perimeter has been overtaken overnight by a rapidly growing, parasitic synthetic ivy that emits a faint, sickening lavender glow. The local rats are not fleeing the infestation; they are cultivating it. The silo's contents are at risk of being consumed, and the party must eradicate the synthetic growth, stop the augmented vermin orchestrating its spread, and uncover the source of this accelerated biological hazard.",

            "turn": 1,
            "narrative": "Under the pale night sky, Silo 4 resembles a gargantuan tumor of vine and leaf rather than an agricultural storage unit. The ivy doesn't merely grow; it writhes with an unnatural, synthetic elasticity, the sound of its rubbing leaves mimicking a dry, collective whisper. A sickly lavender glow pulses through the thickest veins of the plant, illuminating the rusted maintenance door.",
            "choice_a": "Auscultate the vines (Nature DC 12)",
            "consequence_a": "Pressing your ear to the cold steel beneath the vines, you hear the unnatural sap-flow. It's perfectly synchronized with the local mana-grid's rhythmic thrum, revealing that this plant is feeding directly off the ward's power infrastructure.",
            "choice_b": "Prune a path with a silvered blade (Athletics DC 13)",
            "consequence_b": "You hack furiously at the thick, rubbery vines. They bleed a viscous, glowing violet sap that smells sharply of ozone and rotting fruit, but you manage to carve a bloody path directly to the sealed maintenance door.",
            "convergence": "With the exterior vines temporarily pushed back or understood, you stand before the maintenance door. It groans under the immense pressure of the growth within, ready to give way."

            "narrative": "The violet sap has filled the keyhole and fused the heavy iron hinges tight. The smell in the immediate vicinity is sweet, almost intoxicating, attempting to lull your survival instincts into a state of lethargic compliance. Beyond the steel, you can hear the frantic, organized scratching of dozens of tiny claws.",
            "choice_a": "Sledgehammer the hinges (Strength DC 15)",
            "consequence_a": "You swing with brutal, focused force. The warped metal screams and finally gives way, blowing the door inward and showering you in a burst of cold, bioluminescent nectar that sticks to your armor like glue.",
            "choice_b": "Burn the sap with a controlled torch",
            "consequence_b": "You carefully apply heat. The synthetic sap flares an aggressive blue and vaporizes instantly, leaving behind a charred, brittle residue that allows the door to be kicked open. The heat slightly damages the internal locking mechanism.",

            "consequence_b": "You strategically apply a heavy desiccant salt mixture to the primary arterial roots. The vines immediately turn a sickly black and become brittle, severing the bulb's connection to the silo's stolen nutrients.",

            "consequence_a": "You strike with surgical precision, slicing the glowing threads that link the creatures together. Without their hive-mind coordination, the rats immediately fall into chaos, snapping wildly at each other in sudden confusion.",
            "choice_b": "Intimidate the swarm (Intimidation DC 14)",
            "consequence_b": "You let out a terrifying roar, hoping to break their morale. The rats do not even flinch. Connected by the synthetic mind of the ivy, they feel absolutely no fear, only an all-consuming hunger.",
