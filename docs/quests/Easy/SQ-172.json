The 'Squeaker-Box' firmly sits at the exact center of it all: a magnificent, terrifying contraption of raw mana-crystal resonators and vibrating acoustic membranes, roughly the size of a heavy iron safe, with a small brass trumpet functioning as its primary output over a wire cage. His captured test subject, an unusually large warehouse rat whose spine is woven with thick copper, furiously paces inside. Voss aggressively cranks a heavy iron handle. The device hums with a sickening pitch. The rat suddenly goes entirely still, its eyes rolling back, and the brass trumpet announces in a perfectly flat, completely mechanical voice: 'Sector 9. Designated node completely inactive. Replacement sequence officially scheduled.' Voss blinks rapidly in utter shock. 'I thoroughly expected something significantly more... animal,' he admits quietly.",

            "consequence_b": "You completely ignore Voss's shock and frantically copy down the exact, precise mechanical coordinates the brass trumpet is mechanically repeating into your leather journal. You successfully capture the highly sensitive target location perfectly before the machine overheats.",
