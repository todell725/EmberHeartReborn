These augmented rats are bleeding raw potential from passing scavengers and aggressively defending their territory. The party must delve deeply into the rusted labyrinth, neutralize the primitive Void-Beacon coordinating them, and prevent the entire scrapyard from being permanently swallowed by darkness.",
