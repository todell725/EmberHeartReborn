It is in the wall of the Silk Quarter's largest merchant building. It has been there for decades. And it has been quietly animating fabric in this district the whole time. A passive Warp-Static source. Brother Pale knew because he felt it when he walked past. He is annoying, wrong about color theology, AND possesses genuine Warp-sensitivity.",
