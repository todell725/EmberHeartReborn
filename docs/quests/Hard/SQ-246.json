The sheer, violently cracked stone walls are completely slick with an unimaginably foul, thick biological rat-sludge that makes finding any solid handhold nearly impossible. The smell of absolute, ancient decay and concentrated ammonia is utterly overwhelming, burning your exposed throat with every ragged breath. Before you are even halfway down, multiple horrific Dire-Rats\u2014monstrosities easily the size of fully starved timber wolves\u2014aggressively burst screeching from the deeply shadowed crevices to violently defend their deeply contested, stinking subterranean territory.",

A significantly larger, deeply scarred Alpha Dire-Rat, its thick fur heavily mated with thick copper wiring and heavily dried blood, steps aggressively out from entirely behind a rusted boiler, violently barring your solitary path forward into the deeper Undercity tunnels.",

The massive beast instantly violently collapses, its deeply unnatural aggressive coordination completely brutally severed instantly.",
            "choice_b": "Crush it with heavy structural debris (Strength DC 13)",
            "consequence_b": "You completely ignore the beast entirely, violently kicking a perfectly positioned, incredibly heavy rusted iron pipe securely directly entirely out from exactly under a massively heavy pile of dangerously loose structural rubble, violently burying the massive creature completely in heavy stone.",
