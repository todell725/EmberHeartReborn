The cultivated Void-vine at Essa's facility is controlled, agricultural, managed. Whatever is at that symbol point is the vine's wild ancestor \u2014 the source from which the Concordat first took it, before the Scourge interrupted their work and left Essa's line as the only surviving specimen. Dr. Vel has been running spectral analysis on the Glass Shelf's deep-fold region through atmospheric instruments and the results are extraordinary: the grief-crystal concentration in that specific terrain is approximately four hundred times higher than anywhere else on the Shelf. Something is harvesting and concentrating human grief from across the city \u2014 the ambient psychic residue that the Shelf's crystalline structure collects from the Scourge's aftermath \u2014 and transforming it into a compound that a living organism is consuming. Sel, a Fringe researcher who has spent three years mapping the Shelf's geological patterns, contacts you. She says: 'Something in the deep fold is tending it.

The grapes \u2014 if that word applies to clustered crystalline nodules that are simultaneously organic and mineral \u2014 hang heavy with a substance that catches the dim Shelf light like deep purple glass. Each cluster contains grief in a form Vel's instruments cannot fully characterise: not metaphorically, not analogically, but literally \u2014 the crystallised psychic residue of human loss, concentrated, fermented by Void-adjacent processes into a compound of extraordinary potency. Essa's vine produced Void-Wine at trace concentration. This vineyard produces something several orders of magnitude more powerful. Whoever consumes what grows here is not experiencing grief management or mild euphoria. They are consuming distilled human loss at a level that Vel estimates would re-experience not their own grief but the accumulated grief of thousands of Scourge survivors.

He believes he is approximately 130 years old, though he counts by harvests rather than years. He discovered the deep fold's grief-crystal concentration as a young alchemist working for the Concordat, two years before the Scourge. The Concordat's initial plan was to study the crystallised grief as a psychic contaminant \u2014 a Scourge byproduct they needed to understand and potentially disperse. The Vintner's contribution was to discover that a specific vine strain grew naturally at the deep fold's base, already metabolising the grief-crystal into a fermentable compound. He identified the compound's potential not as a weapon or a drug but as a therapy \u2014 a mechanism for safely processing the city's accumulated grief at a population scale. The Scourge arrived before any of this could be implemented. The Concordat dissolved. The Vintner survived by consuming small quantities of the concentrated compound \u2014 which, at the dose he has maintained for a century, does not produce euphoria or dependency but what he calls 'sustained equilibrium.'

He says: 'I have spent a hundred years with only them for company, most of the time. They were not colleagues. They were the neighbourhood. You understand there is a difference.' He is already planning the vineyard's next century rather than mourning its disrupted third month. Whatever option has been chosen \u2014 therapeutic programme, research phase, Ward trusteeship, or his own continued custody \u2014 the Vintner applies himself to implementing it with the focused patience of a man who thinks in decades rather than weeks. The Grief-Harvest's final political question is what to do with Essa. Her cultivated vine is the commercial derivative of the Vintner's ancient stock. The Vethaan Network's actions against her line \u2014 the Celle modifications, the targeting of her operation \u2014 were part of the same programme as the deep fold extraction plan. Essa deserves to know the full story. She is the last surviving independent producer in the thread that runs from Concordat prototype through a hundred years of underground cultivation to the city's most significant grief-processing resource. She also has no idea that the wine she has produced for forty-two years draws on the same root stock as what nearly became a weaponised population-control substance.",

The Violet Shepherd's congregation \u2014 whose void-wine sacrament has been a contentious element of the entire Void-Wine thread \u2014 sends a delegation to wherever the vineyard now exists. Shepherd Cord leads the delegation personally. They do not come asking for access to the therapeutic compound. They come to bring the Vintner a gift: a hand-copied collection of every grief prayer, grief meditation, and grief-processing ritual practice the congregation has developed in three years of working with their community. They say: 'You had the science. We had the practice. Perhaps they were looking for each other.' The Vintner receives the gift with the most emotion he has visibly shown throughout the quest and says: 'I was told the Concordat's therapeutic programme would work alongside existing spiritual practices rather than supplanting them. It is good to know this was correct.' He pauses. 'It is very good to know this was correct.' The Shepherd says: 'The grief does not go away. It becomes something you can carry without dropping.'

The grief-crystal deposits pulse softly, metabolising the city's ambient emotional residue as they always have, converting it into something that can be received and processed. The Vintner says: 'The Concordat built this place \u2014 or rather, they found it and understood it. The Scourge gave it a hundred years to grow without being used. I gave it whatever I could of tending. And now the city knows it exists.' A pause. 'I was afraid for a long time. Coming here was the only thing I knew how to do. Staying was all I could offer.' He looks at the vine rows. 'Now it can be more than staying.' The city's grief, the central wound under every thread investigation, every governance dispute, every faction conflict \u2014 is not healed. It was never going to be healed in a single conversation or a single compound or a single programme. But there is now, for the first time, something genuinely designed to help people through it. The Scourge left a deposit. Something grew in that deposit. Something that, given time and careful tending, gives back. [PERMANENT WORLD EFFECTS]",
