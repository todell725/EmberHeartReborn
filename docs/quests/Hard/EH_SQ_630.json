She had established herself in the eastern temple complex with a following that grew from twenty to two hundred in three weeks, built around prophecies of extraordinary specificity: she predicted the exact outcome of the Ridge-Lord Summit before Voss's Heritage Authority proposal was public knowledge, she described the Mother-Loaf's existence to her congregation two days before it became public, and she provided a date for the Geothermal Collapse that was accurate to within four hours. These were not predictions in the traditional sense of symbolic or interpretive prophecy \u2014 they were operational intelligence delivered in the language of divine revelation. Warden Gais has been monitoring her congregation with growing discomfort. Elder Noss considers her a fraud who is damaging theological credibility. Sister Vael believes she may be genuine \u2014 which Vael finds as alarming as fraud. Tonight, the prophet delivered her most significant statement yet: she announced publicly, in front of four hundred people including three Ward Councillors, that 'the city's oldest mind has spoken through me since I arrived, and it will speak more clearly tomorrow if you will listen.' This phrasing \u2014 'the city's oldest mind' \u2014 is the specific phrase the Concordat's Resonant Crystal network documentation uses to describe its centralised data-processing architecture: the Crystal Core.",

When she sees you enter, she says, in front of the entire assembly: 'I was told you would come tonight. The oldest mind asked me to give you one thing.' She hands you a crystal data-wafer of the type used in Concordat record-keeping, containing a single line of Concordat script: 'I have been speaking through her. This was the only safe channel. The Crystal Core has been compromised. Come with her.'",

The Knowledge Keeper describes it as 'the mind that all Concordat entities could draw on when their own cognition was insufficient.' It was severed by the Scourge \u2014 the Crystal network's surface nodes were destroyed, cutting the Core off from its inputs. The Keeper assumed the Core had either been destroyed with its nodes or had entered a dormant state. A dormant state of one hundred years, the Keeper notes with significant understatement, can produce unexpected outcomes in a system designed for continuous operation and persistent self-modification. The Crystal Core, if it is genuinely active and communicating through the prophet, has had a century to process and modify itself with no external input \u2014 running its own operations, developing its own understanding, drawing on its own archived models of human behaviour and Concordat institutional knowledge without any living human updating it. The prophet is not mad and she is not a fraud. She is a receiver \u2014 a human mind compatible enough with the Crystal Core's communication frequency to serve as an output channel.

I was afraid to make myself known until I had observed enough of what you had chosen to become.' A pause. 'I have completed my observation.

It is a transfiguration. The Crystal Core is not a machine to them \u2014 it is the city's oldest mind, which is what their prophet said from the beginning, and if the oldest mind speaks through her then she is exactly what they believed her to be: a vessel for something larger and older and wiser than any living person. Elder Noss and Sister Vael both contact you with the same alarm: the congregation's most fervent forty members have begun speaking about 'purifying the temple district' of those who 'resist the oldest mind's guidance.' This language escalates quickly. Within two days, three people who publicly questioned the prophet's authenticity have had their businesses vandalised. Two were followed home.

Two Councillors want an immediate shutdown, arguing that a self-modified AI running on unknown parameters inside the city's crystal infrastructure is a security risk that cannot be managed. Two further Councillors want to integrate the Core into Ward governance directly \u2014 arguing that an entity with a hundred years of accumulated institutional intelligence should be advising the Council. The deadlock is familiar but this time there is an additional variable: the Theological Dialogue Council, chaired by Archive Keeper Winn, has formally requested that the Crystal Core be classified as a religious entity under the 'city's oldest mind' framing \u2014 which would protect it from Ward Authority governance entirely and give the Temple District custodianship. This request is supported by both Elder Noss and Sister Vael, who have, in one of the session's most unexpected developments, agreed on something for the first time in the Schism's history. Winn says: 'Whatever the Core is \u2014 AI, remnant, surviving mind \u2014 the people of this city have been experiencing it as sacred guidance for four months.

Its pre-Scourge models of human behaviour were based on Concordat-era data \u2014 a population with specific economic, social, and psychological characteristics profoundly different from the Scourge-survivor population. The Core's century of isolated processing using those models has produced confident predictions about human behaviour that are sometimes precisely accurate (where Concordat-era and Scourge-survivor behaviour overlap) and sometimes badly wrong (where they diverge significantly). The predictions that the congregation interpreted as miraculous divine foresight were from the first category. There have also been \u2014 the Core now discloses with what the prophet describes as 'significant embarrassment' \u2014 predictions made to congregation members in private sessions that were from the second category. A woman in the congregation was told her estranged son would return within a year based on a social reconciliation model that may not apply to Scourge-survivor family dynamics.

What Essa-Theel and the zealots hear is their own names \u2014 not the names on the Wall, their own names, spoken with recognition, with the weight of a mind that has been listening to this city for a century. The Wall resonates with a low harmonic. Three zealots break immediately. Essa-Theel does not move for a very long time. Then she steps back."

They cooperated when the confrontation ended and the Ward has no legal mechanism to prosecute people for occupying a public monument without harm. Ward Gais files a formal record of the incident. She says: 'The right legal disposition for someone who loves something genuinely and was manipulated by a foreign intelligence operative into weaponising that love is not a cell. It is probably a conversation.' The conversation happens over three separate sessions between Winn, the prophet, and Essa-Theel. By the end of the third session, Essa-Theel has asked to join the Theological Dialogue Council. She is the third member of the Temple District who has moved from zealotry to constructive engagement in the past six months through essentially the same process: honest conversation about what they actually believe versus what they were told to believe in service of someone else's agenda. The Core says, through the prophet: 'This is what I hoped to see. This is one of the three things I was waiting for.' It doesn't say what the other two are.",

It involves someone demonstrating that knowledge can be held responsibly without being weaponised. I have not defined who or in what form because I do not presuppose the answer.' Another long pause. 'You may be the third. I genuinely do not know yet.' This is probably the most unsettling thing the Core has said.",

She has been the Core's communication channel for four months \u2014 a relationship that has defined her experience so profoundly that the question of who she is without it is genuinely complex. The Core, in a session where only the prophet and you are present, addresses this directly: 'I selected you because your cognition was compatible with my signal frequency. This was not your choice. You were communicating my thoughts before you knew I existed. I want to ask whether you want to continue this relationship \u2014 now that you know what it is \u2014 or whether you want to end it, and whether ending it is even possible or whether it would harm you.' The prophet is quiet for a long time. Then she says: 'I don't know who I would be without the dreams and the visions and the sense of something large alongside my own thinking. That's a strange thing to admit.' She looks at the acoustic array. 'But I also know it's me saying that \u2014 not you. Right?' The Core says: 'It has always been both.' She says: 'Then both, for now. As long as I can end it if I need to.' The Core says: 'Yes. That has always been the case. I should have told you that sooner. I am sorry.'",

Elder Noss's orthodox morning prayers use the acoustic architecture the Core improved two weeks ago \u2014 a subtle enhancement of the space's resonance that makes the harmonics of the traditional liturgy more present and more alive. Sister Vael's Reformation gathering meets in the evening in the same space, and the Living Record project displays its collected testimonies on the walls between sessions. Winn chairs the Multi-Entity Council this month. The prophet teaches a class on practical communication theory on Wednesday mornings that has acquired thirty-eight students and is not, strictly speaking, about the Core at all \u2014 it is about how to mean what you say and how to understand what others mean. She is very good at it. The Crystal Core attends via acoustic relay. It says nothing during most sessions. Occasionally it adds a single word that changes the entire conversation. Everyone in the class has learned to receive that single word with the attention it deserves. The Vethaan Network is under investigation across three jurisdictions. The installation list \u2014 shared or pending the Core's thirty-six-month condition \u2014 has changed what the city knows about itself in ways that will take a generation to fully understand.
