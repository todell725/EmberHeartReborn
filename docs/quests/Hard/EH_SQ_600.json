The outer walls of three adjoining structures have developed a warm, faintly luminescent golden sheen that Astrid's runner struggles to describe beyond 'it breathes.' When you arrive, a perimeter of Ward Guard holds back a growing crowd. The Yeast Quarter's streets are silent except for a slow, rhythmic exhalation \u2014 the sound of something vast and metabolically active cycling through respiration. Alora stands at the perimeter's edge, her face composed beyond what any expression should logically permit. She says: 'I need to show you something before the Council hears about this.
