The crisis that the cure resolved is still raw in the city's memory: three hundred people dead in four months before the treatment was developed, another sixty saved by its application. The doctor credited with developing the emergency treatment protocol is Chief Researcher Phoss \u2014 a Medical Quarter veteran of thirty years whose previous work on plague-adjacent respiratory conditions gave him the epidemiological foundation for the cure's development. Phoss was publicly decorated by the Ward Council seven months ago. His research methodology is standard, his peer review documentation is thorough, and his cooperation with Dr. Vel's medical team during the crisis was impeccable. Tonight Vel contacts you with a voice that has none of its usual clinical precision. She says: 'Phoss sent me a message this evening. He wants a meeting tomorrow at his private laboratory, not the Medical Quarter. He says \u2014 and I am quoting \u2014 'I need to tell you what the cure actually is before someone else does. And then I need you to understand why you cannot publish it.' She pauses. 'I have known Phoss for fifteen years. He has never said anything like this in my hearing before. I am frightened for him. I am also frightened of him.' She wants you at the meeting.",

I will be as concise as I can. The Crimson Rot cure works. I did not develop it. I found it. And the person I found it from has told me that if I do not provide them with specific cooperation within the next thirty days, they will release a variant of the Rot for which the current cure is ineffective.'

Twelve years ago, when his work on respiratory pathogen treatment first produced results, a contact approached him \u2014 not threatening but extraordinary: offering access to archival pathogen research that would accelerate his work by a decade. The research was extraordinary. It was also clearly of Pre-Scourge Concordat origin, specifically from the Concordat's epidemiological emergency programme \u2014 a classified research branch that had been developing both pathogen modelling and treatment development in parallel, categorising them as a single system: understanding disease to treat it, understanding how to treat it to understand how disease worked. The contact made a single condition for access: when Phoss produced results, a portion of any treatment protocol would be registered under a holding structure that the contact controlled. Not published \u2014 held. A proprietary interest in life-saving medical research. Phoss agreed because the research was real and the treatments saved lives and he believed the holding structure was a legal protection mechanism rather than a weapon. For twelve years, it was. Then the Crimson Rot appeared. Then the holding structure's owner \u2014 the Plague-Maker \u2014 revealed the arrangement's true weight: a treatment protocol for a deadly pathogen, registered under private control, that the city's Medical Quarter was freely distributing on the assumption that it was public medical knowledge. In thirty days, if Phoss did not comply with new demands, the Plague-Maker would release a modified Rot variant for which the registered-private cure was the only existing treatment.",

It is real, it is valid, and it is legally registered under a holding structure that the Ward Authority cannot immediately dissolve \u2014 the legal mechanism Phoss signed is ironclad by current Ward commercial law. The Medical Quarter's legal counsel says: 'The treatment protocol that 847 living people received as emergency care is technically private property. The Ward distributed it freely in good faith, unaware of the registration. The Plague-Maker could, theoretically, sue the Ward for unlicensed use of a proprietary medical protocol.' The political and legal situation is a deliberate trap: the Plague-Maker is not primarily interested in the lawsuit. The registration is leverage \u2014 a standing threat that can be activated at any time to create a legal crisis that disrupts the Medical Quarter's operations. The demonstration vial that was sent to Phoss is real. Vel has analysed it: it is a modified Rot variant with a mutation pattern she describes as 'precisely targeted to the cure's current mechanism.' Someone with extraordinary pathogen expertise deliberately engineered a variant that defeats the existing cure. They then registered the cure before the variant existed. The registration predates the Rot outbreak by three months. The Crimson Rot was deliberately released by the same entity that held the cure.

The Morren Family, whose referral fee corruption was prosecuted successfully, has a subsidiary structure that was not investigated at the time because it appeared to be a dormant shell with no active operations. The subsidiary is called Morren Epidemiological Research Partners. It has been active for fourteen years. Its registered expertise is 'Pre-Scourge archival pathogen documentation and treatment protocol recovery.' This is what Phoss was told he was accessing: historical medical research. What he was actually accessing was the Morren Family's private programme to acquire proprietary control over Concordat-origin treatment protocols for every major pathogen type in the Ward's recorded history.

Vel's analysis of the demonstration vial has produced an understanding of the variant's mechanism, and she has been working continuously for five days on a counter-treatment. Her current assessment: a counter-treatment is theoretically achievable but requires Morren's own research records, which contain the specific mutation parameters used. Without those records, Vel can model a broad-spectrum counter-treatment that might work for most variant presentations. With the records, she can develop an exact cure with certainty.

The prosecution proceeds on a full evidentiary record including the pathogen engineering documentation, Phoss's protected testimony, the payment records, the staging evidence, the external-partner network, the archive's governance records showing sixty years of proprietary medical protocol capture, and the suborning-of-testimony charges. Morren's legal team makes a final offer: full cooperation and disclosure of the Vethaan Network's medical intelligence operation in exchange for reduced sentencing consideration. The offer is genuine and the information would be significant. Coss is already cooperating fully. The question is whether Morren's cooperation on the Network adds enough value to warrant the reduction his team is seeking.",

Vel \u2014 designated as its first operational director \u2014 begins the systematic review of what the archive contains. The first month's findings are extraordinary: treatment protocols for eight diseases that currently have no effective treatment in the Ward's medical knowledge. Most are rare. Two are not \u2014 one is the primary respiratory illness that kills approximately thirty Ward residents each winter, for which the archive contains a Concordat-era treatment that was never implemented because the Scourge interrupted distribution. Vel's team begins adapting the archive protocol to current Medical Quarter standards. By the following winter, the respiratory treatment is in production. The winter mortality figures, when reviewed the following spring, show a 40% reduction in respiratory-related deaths. Calla, in her patient advocacy role, is one of the first people to receive the adapted treatment when she develops a respiratory infection in December. She recovers completely in four days. She sends Vel a single note: 'Thank you.' Vel is in her office when she receives it. She sits with it for a while before putting it on her desk.",
