Fourteen have been assessed \u2014 two communications relays, five resource caches, three maintenance depots, two energy conduit junctions, and two hydrogeological monitoring stations. The fifteenth site, designated on the maps with a triple-sigil notation that the Knowledge Keeper identifies as the Concordat's highest operational security classification, has been left for last by mutual agreement. It is the deepest site \u2014 four hundred and sixty metres below the Ridge's surface, accessible only through a shaft system that requires two days of descent with specialised equipment. When Pyra's survey team finally reaches the shaft's base and sends back their first atmospheric reading, they stop communicating entirely for six hours. When Dorr reaches them via the crystal relay, their first message contains only four words: 'It is already running.' The Deep-Forge \u2014 the Concordat's classified manufacturing installation \u2014 has never been dormant. It has been operating continuously for a hundred years in full production mode, unmonitored, unmaintained, and completely autonomous.

Storage bays line the production floor's walls \u2014 each bay is stacked floor to ceiling with completed components awaiting final assembly. At conservative estimate, Pyra calculates that the components in storage represent between two and three hundred complete combat automata at 60-70% build completion. The final assembly stage does not appear to have been activated. Somewhere in the Forge's operational logic, a condition that would trigger final assembly has not yet been met. The Forge is waiting for something. The Knowledge Keeper, when Dorr relays this assessment, says carefully: 'The Class Omega activation protocol required two-stage authorisation: first, an existential threat identification by the Concordat high council; second, a field commander's activation order to begin final assembly and deployment of the produced units. The forge received the first authorisation \u2014 it would not be running otherwise. It never received the second, because the field commanders did not survive the Scourge to give it. The forge has been waiting, for a hundred years, for an activation order that no one is left to give.' A significant pause.

Second, the Ward Council itself recognises the Forge as a potential city-defence resource and votes to classify it as a Ward Emergency Military Asset \u2014 which would give the Council joint control and potentially override all Ridge Authority jurisdiction. Third, and most immediately, the Forge's autonomous systems detect the increased human activity around the shaft entrance and execute what appears to be a pre-programmed response to sustained access: the Forge-Guardian activates. The Guardian is the installation's primary security automaton \u2014 a Class Omega unit that was built and deployed before the Forge's production capability was complete, designed to protect the installation against any unauthorised intrusion.

The Ward Council's military classification attempt fails legally when Heritage Authority counsel challenges it in full Council session \u2014 the sequence Astrid documents makes the classification a procedural error that does not survive review. The two Councillors who drove the classification are formally cautioned. The Forge facility is secure. Pyra begins the decommissioning work with the Guardian's active cooperation \u2014 it assists in the disassembly process with a precision no human team could match, moving components with its full articulated capability in service of dismantling the production lines it spent a century guarding. There is something in this reversal that Pyra notes in her engineering log: 'The system that built these has spent today carefully unbuilding them. It seems to understand the necessity. It seems, if I am reading its behaviour correctly, relieved.' The Knowledge Keeper says: 'The Concordat built the Forge because it thought war was coming. The war came anyway, and the Forge was not what survived it. People were. Communities were. Institutions that were worth preserving were. The Forge was worth preserving only in the sense that everything it knew remains \u2014 just directed toward connection rather than conflict.' A pause.

Relief is what happens when the purpose you were built for no longer requires harm.'",

Researchers from the Academic Quarter, Medical Quarter, and the Heritage Authority's own expanding research division present papers about what the autonomous facility's century of operation reveals about Concordat engineering, autonomous systems design, and Resonant Crystal power applications. The Guardian attends. Not as security \u2014 it was invited. It positions itself at the back of the session room and does not disturb anyone. When a researcher presents a paper on the Guardian's design specifically, the Guardian does not leave or react aggressively. It waits until the presentation's question period and then \u2014 using the Concordat query protocol that Dorr translates in real-time \u2014 asks a single question about the accuracy of the design documentation being cited. The room goes very quiet. Dorr translates. The researcher answers. The Guardian indicates approval with a low harmonic. The session continues. Pyra, in the front row, does not say anything.
