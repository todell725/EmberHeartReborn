Three Ridge-Lords \u2014 Fenn (whose labour violations you exposed), Darrow (ambitious and newly arrived), and Elder Voss (the oldest and most established) \u2014 are now competing to control the infrastructure programme. Overseer Kell has called a formal Summit to prevent a factional breakdown. She asks you to attend as a neutral adviser. The session will determine who controls the most significant find in a generation.",

            "narrative": "The Summit Hall is a vaulted chamber at the Ridge's administrative peak, reserved for significant multi-Lord negotiations. All three Ridge-Lords arrive with advisers and legal representatives. Fenn is over-dressed and nervous \u2014 your earlier exposure of his labour violations clearly damaged his standing. Darrow is younger and direct, presenting an immediate commercial proposal. Elder Voss sits with quiet patience and says nothing for the first twenty minutes. Kell opens by stating that the Ward Council has not yet designated control authority \u2014 this Summit is meant to produce a recommendation.",
            "choice_a": "Begin by proposing that control should be determined by institutional mandate rather than Lord authority",

            "choice_b": "Listen to each Lord's opening argument before offering any framework",
            "consequence_b": "Fenn argues property rights \u2014 the mine section is under his licence area. Darrow argues first-mover advantage \u2014 his survey investment was largest. Voss argues that historical Ridge-Lord authority predates all of them."

She does not have a vote but she does have the legal right to address the assembly on behalf of the 847 miners who work the deep sections. When she stands to speak, the room becomes extremely still. She says: 'The miners broke through that wall. The find belongs to the Ridge community \u2014 not the Lords.' This is not legally binding. But the room's response to it reveals who actually has moral authority here.",
            "choice_a": "Support Renia's statement openly and propose a community governance model",
            "consequence_a": "Voss supports this immediately. Fenn looks calculating. Darrow objects \u2014 his investment has no return under a community model.",

            "narrative": "Darrow makes a bold proposal: he will fund the entire infrastructure integration programme \u2014 communication station restoration, energy station upgrade, resource cache management \u2014 in exchange for a forty-year exclusive licensing arrangement over the infrastructure network's commercial output. The proposal is financially sound. It is also a private takeover of a public discovery. The other two Lords are silent, assessing whether to compete or cooperate.",

            "narrative": "Fenn, sensing the political dynamics shifting against his property-rights argument and seeing an opportunity, makes a private approach. He quietly reveals that he has documentation suggesting Darrow's survey investments were funded through a shell company with connections to the same High Ward trading families involved in the Bread Cartel commodity manipulation. Fenn is offering this as an exchange for your support of his governance model. His information may be valuable. His motivation certainly is not altruistic.",

His proposal is the most sophisticated of the three: a Ridge Mining Heritage Authority, jointly governed by the three Ridge-Lords in rotating chairmanship, with mandatory worker representation and Ward Council liaison. The proposal was clearly pre-prepared \u2014 Voss came to this Summit knowing what he wanted and waited for the other two to exhaust themselves.",

            "narrative": "The governance model is agreed in principle. The Summit breaks for the night with a working document to be finalised the next morning. During the dinner recess, you overhear a brief exchange between Darrow and an aide that stops you cold. They say a name \u2014 not clearly, not fully \u2014 but enough to suggest 'V-something' and refer to 'the timing problem at the mine.' This could be nothing. Or Darrow's shell company connection runs further than the Bread Cartel families.",

But overnight, Foreman Ness has discovered that someone attempted to access the communication station without authorisation \u2014 boot prints, a disturbed door seal, and an abandoned piece of equipment identified as a sophisticated listening device. One of the Summit participants, an adviser's aide, cannot be accounted for.",
            "choice_a": "Halt the signing until the security breach is investigated",

The breach investigation continues in the background. The Concordat infrastructure integration programme has its governance and begins proper execution. The Ridge community \u2014 miners, maintenance workers, the Vapour Lark Zone's residents \u2014 quietly celebrates. A district that was being stripped of resources and exploited for cheap labour is now in genuine institutional transformation.",

In his first week he identifies three additional Concordat facility locations that the technical teams had not found. He presents his findings in the Heritage Authority's first formal session with a quiet confidence that has nothing to do with his previous modest miner's identity. The crystal experience changed him \u2014 made him something new.",

If you sealed it, Voss privately reveals that his family records include a Pre-Scourge Concordat notation about 'the preserved witnesses' \u2014 entities sealed in crystal suspension beneath the Ridge as insurance against the Scourge consuming all institutional memory. Either version converges on the same truth: the CONTAINMENT chamber holds a Concordat institutional memory keeper, sealed for over a century.

The Concordat did not die. It waited. The Heritage Authority's first major challenge is now its most significant: integrating Pre-Scourge institutional memory with a century of Scourge-era experience.
