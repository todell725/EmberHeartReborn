Now a Water Authority worker reports a massive warm-air smell rising from a sealed Undercity access shaft beneath the old Yeast Quarter \u2014 a section of the Market Ward that mass-produced yeast before the Scourge. Someone is running an unauthorised operation underground. Warden Astrid suspects it is connected to the Cartel's successor or a new player exploiting the power vacuum.",

When you pry the cover, a warm yeasty exhalation rolls up from below. The shaft descends twelve metres via a metal ladder, clearly maintained and recently oiled. The smell is warm bread combined with something acrid \u2014 a fermentation process operating at industrial scale. Brenn says the heat signature on the surface has been consistent for at least two years. Whatever is down there has been running long before the Cartel's recent disruptions.",

Their supervisor, Yeast Chemist Alora, emerges from a side office with the calm authority of someone who has been managing a public secret for years. She does not seem surprised to see you. 'I wondered when Astrid would find us,' she says, and pours two cups of herbal tea from a kettle on her workbench. 'Would you like to understand what we're actually doing before you decide whether to shut us down?'",
