The fourth time, barely three weeks ago, I clearly heard the heavy production cycle violently running.' She has told absolutely no one until exactly now. The brilliant, hand-sketched map is extraordinary in its terrifying detail. She points a shaking finger directly to Section 3: 'This is precisely where the smell completely changes.
