The missing goods are diverse: medicines, food preservatives, alchemical compounds, and tool metal stock. No single thread except transit routing. Three Lower Ward community leaders have formally complained about supply chain reliability. Warden Astrid suspects professional cargo diversion \u2014 not theft but sophisticated rerouting that redirects goods to unlicensed buyers before official delivery.",
