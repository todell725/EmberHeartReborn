    "description": "Three months after the Heritage Authority's formation, Engineer Pyra's atmospheric sensors detect an anomaly in the Ridge's geothermal pressure network: the primary vent nexus \u2014 the convergence point of all eight major geothermal lines \u2014 is showing a pressure accumulation pattern that has no precedent in modern records. Pyra calculates an 85% probability of catastrophic release within 96 hours unless the pressure is actively managed. A full collapse of the nexus would vent superheated steam and geothermal gas across an area covering the Ridge and adjacent Lower Ward, potentially killing hundreds.",

The pressure accumulation began forty-eight hours ago \u2014 the same period during which the energy station restoration work (from EH_SQ_521) has been running at elevated output. The two are connected: increasing the energy station's throughput has altered the geothermal flow balance across the network. The restoration crew inadvertently destabilised the system that has been in equilibrium for a century. Pyra says: 'We have about ninety hours to either equalise the pressure or evacuate a twelve-block radius including most of the Lower Ward adjacency.' Both are necessary \u2014 evacuation as insurance, pressure management as real solution.",

The other two are in sections 5 and 7, neither of which has been inspected in over two decades. Section 7's access route goes through the Concordat communication station, which is currently in active operation mode. Disrupting its signal patterns risks complications with the Resonant Crystal arrays.",

            "narrative": "Forty-eight hours into the incident, a second complication emerges: the geothermal pressure spike is not just accumulation from the energy station increase. Pyra's refined models show that a deep fault 400 metres below the nexus has been slowly shifting for six months \u2014 long before the energy station work began. The energy station restoration accelerated a process that was already underway. This fault shift is a structural geological event that the controlled release valves can only delay, not solve.",
