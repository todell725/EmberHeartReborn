They do not appear distressed. They appear reverent. Their leader, a soft-spoken figure in grey robes called the Violet Shepherd, teaches that Void-Wine is not an addiction but a sacrament \u2014 a gift from the Void that allows humans to perceive a reality beyond physical suffering. Temple Authority Warden Gais wants the congregation understood before deciding how to respond. Brother Avel, Shrine keeper, is in over his head.",

They move quietly and deliberately, displaying none of the distress or disorientation associated with Void-Wine addiction. The Violet Shepherd stands at the centre reading from what appears to be a self-produced text. When the reading ends, they distribute small measures of Void-Wine from a clay vessel in a ritual that mirrors the Concordat sacrament ceremony almost exactly. Brother Avel watches from his doorway looking deeply uncomfortable.",

They are a former Academic Quarter physician named Cord who experienced a profound Void vision during a severe grief episode twelve years ago. They believe the vision was real \u2014 a genuine perception of a post-death continuity \u2014 and have built a theology around the controlled use of Void-Wine to facilitate similar visions in others. They have developed a dosing protocol that maximises the visionary experience while preventing acute addiction crises. Their congregation has twenty chronically-saturated members and ten 'sacrament trainees.' Cord is intelligent, sincere, and from a medical standpoint, aware of exactly what they are doing.",

But the twenty chronically-saturated members concern her: their violet eyes indicate irreversible neurological changes.
