The operation targets grief with pharmaceutical precision, identifies new victims within days of a death, and makes contact through seemingly sympathetic community figures. Warden Astrid has received sixteen formal addiction complaints this month alone, all from recently bereaved Lower Ward families. This is not opportunistic \u2014 it is a designed predation network.",

Every single victim received their first Void-Wine dose within ten days of a funeral and all of them were approached by someone they trusted \u2014 a community healer, a neighbourhood leader, a distant relative who appeared suddenly. The pattern is too consistent to be coincidence. Someone inside the bereavement community is identifying and flagging new targets.
