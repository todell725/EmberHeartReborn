Led by Petra and Gorm \u2014 who have now merged their operations \u2014 forty-three bakers present a formal petition to the Merchant Guild demanding independent licensing, price floor protections, and the right to buy flour directly from the Agricultural Zone without Guild intermediaries. The Guild has responded by revoking five bakers' licences on technical grounds within 24 hours. A full trade confrontation is building. This is the bakers' chance to break free from Guild control permanently \u2014 or be crushed before they have fully organised.",

The document is thorough, legally cited, and signed by forty-three proprietors. Gorm has a bruise on his jaw. He says Guild enforcers visited last night to explain why the petition was 'inadvisable.'

Within forty-eight hours, two of the largest wheat trading families withdraw supply contracts from six bakeries who are part of the petition.

Two weeks after the settlement or ruling, a new entity appears in the Ward's commercial registry: The Market Ward Grain Collective, capitalised at significant funds and immediately offering bakeries below-market flour prices. It is an attempt to buy influence that the Guild lost through legitimate competition \u2014 making the bakers financially dependent again but through economic rather than coercive means.",

By nightfall, you have received three anonymous messages: one is a note of congratulation that feels menacing, one is a threat to your physical safety, and one says only the name 'Vethaan' with a bread loaf drawn beneath it.",
