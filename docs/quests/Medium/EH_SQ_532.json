    "description": "Transit Corridor workers have gone on strike after fifteen years without a formal pay review. The Corridor's 340 workers manage every cargo and passenger movement between six districts \u2014 without them, supply chains stop, worker transport to the Foundry and Industrial Quarter ceases, medical supply deliveries fail, and the Agricultural Zone's perishables cannot reach the Market Ward. The Ward Council has called the strike 'illegal under emergency provision law.' Labour Advocate Renia calls that characterisation 'a deliberate misreading of statute.' The city is holding its breath. The strike is already in its second day.",

            "narrative": "Transit Strike Leader Forris explains the situation in precise terms: the Corridor's workers have not received a pay review since the Scourge emergency provisions were first applied fifteen years ago. Every review request has been deferred under the same emergency clause. The clause \u2014 designed for temporary crisis \u2014 has been applied continuously for a decade and a half. The workers' base wages are now significantly below every comparable Ward labour category. 'We waited,' Forris says. 'We filed. We petitioned. We're done waiting.' He shows you a two-centimetre-thick folder of denied review requests.",
            "choice_a": "Position yourself as a neutral mediator between the workers and the Ward Authority",
            "consequence_a": "Both Forris and Councillor Dain accept. A mediation session is scheduled for tomorrow \u2014 but the city has 24 hours before supply chain disruption becomes critical.",

            "consequence_b": "A Ward legal reviewer finds the 15-year continuous application deeply questionable. The emergency provision permits 12-month renewable deferrals but requires evidence of genuine emergency to renew \u2014 evidence never formally provided."

Day three of the strike will begin to affect production. Vane is not hostile to the workers \u2014 she has publicly supported previous labour rights measures \u2014 but she needs resolution. She offers to publicly support an immediate provisional pay increase from Foundry operating funds if it helps break the deadlock, noting that the Foundry has a direct stake in Transit Corridor workers being fairly compensated.",
            "choice_a": "Bring Vane's offer to the negotiating table immediately as external financial evidence",

If you present it now, the Ward Council's position collapses \u2014 but Dain may become hostile and the political resolution becomes confrontational. If you hold it in reserve, you preserve goodwill but accept a slower process.",

The Medical Quarter's Dr. Vel contacts you: perishable medicines and blood products cannot be stored indefinitely. If transit does not resume for medical cargo within twelve hours, two critical care patients at the Medical Quarter will be at risk. This is not manipulative framing \u2014 Vel is clinically precise. Strike Leader Forris, when told, immediately designates medical cargo as a humanitarian exemption subject to voluntary Transit worker coverage.",

The retroactive payment \u2014 modest but significant \u2014 is the sticking point. Dain is willing to fund the prospective increase from Ward operating budget but argues the retroactive element requires Council approval he cannot guarantee.",
