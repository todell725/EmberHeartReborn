Scout teams sent to clear it report organized resistance and 'voices in the dark.' The party must navigate the effluent tunnels, breach the barricade made of stolen noble wealth, and confront the Rat King\u2014a horrifyingly intelligent, augmented escapee from Concordat-era experiments who demands a life-price for the city's flow.",

The blockage ahead is not merely accumulated trash; it is a meticulously constructed, structural dam built entirely from the stolen silver, jewelry, and polished bone of the Upper Ward.",
