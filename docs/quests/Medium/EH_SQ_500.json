Three separate bakery incidents in the past month weren't coincidences \u2014 they were orchestrated. A criminal cartel has been systematically seizing control of Market Ward's bread supply by pressuring owners into protection arrangements. Two bakers who refused have had their shops 'accidentally' destroyed by fire.",

In the past three months, fourteen of them have begun paying weekly 'security fees' to a man known only as Donn. Two who refused had their properties destroyed in fires that the Fire Watch ruled accidental. The seventeenth \u2014 Baker Mira \u2014 is still refusing and is terrified. Astrid cannot move formally without evidence tying the fires to Donn \u2014 he is careful and well-connected. She needs someone who can work outside the official investigation, building a case brick by brick before Donn's boss learns they're being watched. You accept.",
