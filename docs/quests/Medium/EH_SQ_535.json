She has found systematic discrepancies across six doctors who collectively manage the Medical Quarter's patient transfer system: patients assessed as 'critical' are being transferred to private High Ward care at rates four times higher than any clinical guideline justifies, while Low Ward patients with equivalent conditions are marked 'stable' and placed in waiting patterns. The aide believes some doctors are receiving payments to preferentially transfer High Ward patients to premium beds. Dr. Vel is not among the suspect doctors \u2014 but two of them report to her division.",
