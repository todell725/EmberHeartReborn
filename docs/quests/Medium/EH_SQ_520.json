    "description": "A mining crew in Section 9 of the Ridge deep mine has broken through into a sealed Pre-Scourge chamber \u2014 but this is not an artefact cache or survey workshop. The space beyond is intact, operational, and apparently powered: lights are on, mechanisms are turning, and a low hum of active machinery fills the newly opened gap. Three miners have already entered and cannot be reached by voice. The Ridge Authority has suspended all drilling within 200 metres and requested immediate assistance from whoever recovered the Resonant Crystal and Artificer Ollen's journal.",

Mining Foreman Ness grips the edge of the breach and calls names into the corridor. Silence \u2014 then a faint sound, rhythmic and mechanical, that is definitely not human. Overseer Kell stands behind you. 'Three men are in there,' she says. 'The machinery is active. Tell me what I'm dealing with.'",

They are conscious but unresponsive to your presence.",

They are not harmed but are receiving a continuous audio-visual signal from the crystal array above them. Their eyes are tracking moving patterns only they can see. Similar to Void-Wine visions but structured, architectural, deliberate.",

The facility itself demands attention. This is clearly a Concordat communication and mapping station \u2014 designed to broadcast Resonant Crystal signals across deep terrain. The clockwork assembly machine (EH_SQ_458) has been receiving this signal. This station is its intended correspondent.",

The maps show features that do not match any current survey: passages, chambers, resource deposits, and three locations marked with the Concordat's highest security designation. One marked location is directly below the Scourge Fringe's most active zone.",

One is apparently a Concordat emergency resource cache \u2014 food, tools, and preserved infrastructure components stored before the Scourge in case of catastrophic surface damage. One appears to be an energy generation station still possibly operational.

Kell wants it investigated. Astrid wants it left alone. Dr. Vel has been contacted and is urgently requesting access.

The clockwork assembly machine's operator (from EH_SQ_458) arrives at the Ridge, visibly excited, with Engineer Pyra (from EH_SQ_426). Together they believe the station can serve as a deep-city communication relay \u2014 providing a Concordat-era communication infrastructure for the Ridge, Undercity operations, and Fringe expeditions. The practical value is enormous. The energy system that powers it is still active and has been running for over a century.",

His drawings match three of the seventeen underground structures on the deep-layer maps with extraordinary accuracy. The crystal array showed him real places. He wants to know if you can find a way to get him back in \u2014 controlled, with understanding of what is happening.",

It is a geothermal-to-Resonant-Crystal energy conversion system, using the same heat sources that the modern Ridge vent arrays tap for heating. It has been running continuously for over a century, maintenance-free, at approximately 40% of its original capacity. If restored to full capacity it could double the Ridge's usable energy output.",

Their report arrives: the CONTAINMENT location is a sealed chamber approximately 200 metres below the active Scourge Fringe. The seal is Concordat-grade and shows no integrity failure after a century. What is inside is not documented \u2014 only the classification level. A decision must be made.
