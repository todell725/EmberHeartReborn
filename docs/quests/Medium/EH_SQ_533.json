A doctrinal dispute \u2014 seemingly academic \u2014 has escalated into a genuine schism between the Orthodox Concordat-Remnant faction and the Reformation Faction, who believe the Scourge revealed that the old Concordat theology was incomplete. The dispute has three flashpoints: the city's memorial prayer schedule, access to the Archive of Lost Voices, and the legitimacy of the Violet Shepherd's congregation. What began as theological argument is now affecting district politics, community cohesion, and \u2014 most urgently \u2014 a dispute over which faction controls the largest food distribution charity in the Temple District.",

The orthodox faction, led by Elder Noss, has formally contested the Reformation faction's management of the Temple District Relief Charity \u2014 the body that distributes food and medicine to 800 low-income Temple and Lower Ward residents each week. Noss argues that the Reformation faction's doctrinal heterodoxy disqualifies them from managing a Concordat-heritage charitable institution. Sister Vael argues that Noss is using theological grounds to execute a resource-control grab disguised as principle.",

Elder Noss's orthodox position is that the Concordat's doctrines are a recorded inheritance from people wiser than current survivors, and that the Reformation faction's experiential theology is individualism disguised as revelation. Both positions are sincere. Both have genuine merit.",
