The Court is a deeply unnatural biological structure made entirely of fused living rats, and the King himself is a massive amalgamation of hundreds of dire-rats bound magically at the tails.",

At the very center of this breathing throne sits the King himself: a massive, terrifying amalgamation of hundreds of alpha dire-rats, their tails magically fused together in an unbreakable, pulsing knot. He speaks directly into your mind with a dozen overlapping, screeching voices.",

            "consequence_a": "You dive under a sweeping limb and hack violently at the central, pulsing knot of fused tails. The dark magic breaks instantly, and the King screams as his hundreds of component bodies violently tear themselves apart to escape.",
