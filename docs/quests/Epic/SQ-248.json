A massive, telepathic 'Rat King' is organizing the swarm to attack the city's primary remaining food silos. The party must defend the reinforced steel doors from a sea of gnashing teeth and deal with the monstrous Tunneling-Beast sieging the structure.",

A literal sea of grey fur and snapping, diseased teeth is mindlessly gnawing through the reinforced lower steel doors of the primary grain reserve.
