A literal 'Vermintide'\u2014a tidal wave of panicked, fleeing rats\u2014is rushing endlessly up the main pumping stations to desperately escape the Undercity.

A literal 'Vermintide' is aggressively rushing up the pipes, desperately trying to escape the deep tunnels. If they breach the gates, the lower wards will be completely overrun.
