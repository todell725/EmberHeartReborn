# Session 6: The Breach of Orbit
**Date**: 2026-02-17
**DM**: Athena

## The Sovereign Offensive
With the Solar Siphon offline and the local Spire "Purification" fleet seized, Emberheart has transitioned from defense to active orbital dominance. King Kaelrath has commanded the final push: Target 75 Wardens and seize the remaining orbital jewelry around the Ridge's world.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **The Warden Tide**: Produce 59 more Ember-Wardens to reach the 75-unit goal (Legacy Army).
2. **Fleet Integration**: Fully slave the *Sanctity*, *Radiance*, and *Purge* to the Pilot-Echo network.
3. **The First Leap**: Breach high orbit to dismantle or seize Spire research platforms, orbital foundries, and the "Jewels" (Orbital Cities).

### Technical Details
- **Current Location**: The North Rim Docks / Sovereignty Plaza.
- **PCs**: King Kaelrath (Lvl 5 Soulknife), Talmarr (Lvl 5 Gloom Stalker), Silvy (Lvl 5 Lore Bard), Mareth (Lvl 5 Battle Master), Vaelis (Lvl 5 Evocation).
- **Current Objective**: Initiate the Warden Production Blitz (Target 75).
- **World State**: Week 6 (Highflare). Sovereign Superpower.

## STORY SO FAR
The sun has returned. After the legendary victory at the North Rim, the people of Emberheart no longer look at the sky with fear, but with hunger. The Spire's "Purification Sweep" provided the steel the Ridge needed to become a true interstellar power. Now, the King prepares his Legions of iron and steam to reclaim the heavens.

## SESSION LOG
### Resolution: The Iron Dawn (Week 6, Day 7)
- **The Blitz (Haldor 18)**: Using the Overseer Logic Core and the combined might of 270 technicians, the foundries hit the target of **75 Ember-Wardens** in record time.
- **The Cooperation (Mareth 18)**: The captured Spire crew has fully integrated. They've seen the King's strength and Mareth's discipline; they are now working as a cohesive industrial force.
- **The Fleet Sync (Vaelis 18)**: The *Sanctity*, *Radiance*, and *Purge* are no longer "captured prizes." They are active EH-Vessels, their Pilot-Echoes humming in total harmony.

## THE TRIPLE STRIKE: OPERATION JEWEL-THIEF (Resolution - Rolls: 19)
The Sovereign offensive was executed with legendary precision. The sky above the Ridge is now indisputably Emberheart territory.

1. **The Foundry Heist (Haldor 19)**: Strike Force 1 has seized the High-Orbit Foundry. The 3 Frigates currently in the berths were "hot-wired" into the Pilot-Echo net before the Spire crew could purge their logic cores. We now have a fleet of 6 Frigates.
2. **The "Solar Eye" Blackout (Vaelis 19)**: The relay is ours. Vaelis has slaved the local drone-swarms, creating an automated defense layer that even Concordia can't penetrate without a full-scale invasion. 
3. **The Gilded Canopy (Kaelrath 19 / Mareth 19)**: The orbital city has fallen. High-Command was taken in their pajamas. We have 78 high-ranking hostages, including the regional sector governor.

### AFTERMATH: THE SOVEREIGN SKY
Emberheart's reach now extends from the deepest mines to the edge of the atmosphere. 

**Updated Fleet**:
- 2x Dreadnoughts
- 2x Heavy Corvettes
- 6x Frigates
- Thousands of Automated Drones

## RESOLUTION: THE RHYTHMIC PEACE (Rolls: 19)
The dual focus on the Shield and the Shaft has yielded a result that secures Emberheart for generations.

1. **The Aegis Deployment (Vaelis 19)**: The Orbital Shield Array is active. A shimmering web of star-forge energy now surrounds the world. The Sires' "Purification" beams are now useless; they cannot touch the soil without our permission.
2. **The Heart of the Mountain (Haldor 19)**: The Warden escorts broke through the final layer of basalt. They found the **Resonant Catalyst**—a massive, living crystal that pulses with the world's heartbeat. This is not a threat; it is the world's battery. Vaelis has used a fragment to stabilize **Project Helios** permanently. Emberheart now has infinite energy.
3. **The Sovereign Treaty (Mareth 19)**: Using the hostages and the display of the active Aegis shield, Mareth has negotiated a **System-Wide Recognition**. Concordia Prime has signed a non-aggression pact. They sent a designated transport ship, the *Mercy's Reach*, to extract their citizens.

**The Right of Choice**: Per King Kaelrath's command, the hostages were offered a choice: return to the cold bureaucracy of Concordia or stay in Emberheart as compensated specialists with full food, shelter, and modern rights.
- **Outcome**: A significant portion of the technical and scientific staff (the "Gilded Defectors") have chosen to stay, enticed by the Resonant Catalyst's potential and the King's fair rule.

**Final Status**:
- **Energy Status**: Infinite (via Catalyst).
- **Defense Status**: Immune to Orbital Bombardment.
- **Diplomatic Status**: Recognized Sovereign State.
- **Legitimacy**: 950 (The Golden Age).
