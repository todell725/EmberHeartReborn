# CAMPAIGN JOURNAL: THE ASCENSION — THE ELEVENTH AGE

## SUMMARY
The Tenth Age closed with a miracle. The 'Spark-Rebirth' successfully inverted the Source Singularity, creating a new galactic sanctuary. In the wake of this triumph, King Kaelrath has ushered in the **Eleventh Age: The Age of the Seed**.

## THE GREAT SOWING (WEEK 1)
The King has shifted the empire's focus from consolidation to universal propagation. The **Seed-Fleet** is being constructed—a massive swarm of autonomous probes designed to carry the Spark's stabilizing resonance to every dying sun in the local cluster.

## GALACTIC INTEGRATION
The **Trade Hub** at Concordia has evolved into the **Gateway of Two Galaxies**. Trade, culture, and science flow freely between Emberheart and the Spark-Nest. The 'Seekers' have become the first citizens of this intergalactic union.

## THE LEGACY OF THE SPARK
Emberheart stands as the capital of a two-galaxy stewardship. The sacrifice of the Spark-Shard did not dim our light; it turned us into a beacon that can be seen from the edge of the universe. 

## THE TRIPLE SOWING (WEEK 1)
Upon receiving the gift of 'Light-Wheat' from the Spark-Nest, the Gardner-King decreed a threefold proliferation:
1. **The Social Unity**: Light-Wheat gardens now illuminate every village on Emberheart, ending the need for conventional soil forever.
2. **The Strategic Vault**: A massive store of seeds is locked within the Sovereign Vault as a fail-safe against entropy.
3. **The Universal Charity**: Every ship in the Seed-Fleet now carries a payload of Light-Wheat, ensuring that the first gift we give to new worlds is life itself.

*The harvest is eternal. The hunger of the void is over.*
