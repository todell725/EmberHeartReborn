# Project: Spark-Warp Network
**Lead Researchers**: Vaelis Thorne (Arcane), Queen Elara (History)
**Status**: RESEARCH PHASE (Week 14)

## The Goal
To create a network of instant-travel portals ("Warp-Gates") linking Emberheart to its vassal worlds and fleet assets, bypassing the need for long-haul void travel.

## Technical Hypotheses
1.  **The Anchor Theory**: Utilizing the World-Spark as a "Central Hub" and smaller Spark-Crystals as "Anchors" on destination worlds.
2.  **The Risk**: Opening a door allows anything to walk through. Security must be absolute.

## Research Log
- **Week 14, Day 5**: Proposal accepted by the Council.
    - **Current Obstacle**: Stabilizing the event horizon without consuming the Anchor Crystal.
    - **Proposed Solution**: "Harmonic Resonance" - using the song of the planet (Elara's domain) to soothe the spatial tear.

## Network Nodes (Planned)
- **Node Zero**: The Sky-Palace Rotunda (The Hub).
- **Node One**: The Cobalt Moon (Proposed - if colony integration succeeds).
- **Node Two**: The Accordance (Mobile Flagship Gate).

## Development Tasks
- [ ] Vaelis: Calculate the Spark-Frequency required for a stable 10-person gate.
- [ ] Elara: Locate historical references to the "Old Bridges."
- [ ] Malakor: Design the "Gate-Breaker" failsafe (explosive disconnect).
